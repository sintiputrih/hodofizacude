It was an excellent and atmospheric film.</a> from <a href=#>horror</a></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Burnt Offerings follows a family who move into a grand estate for just $900 for a whole summer, but with a strange caveat from the landlords: their elderly mother must be allowed to live in the upstairs room while they stay, and fed by the guests. Doubly strange, they are never allowed to speak or interact with her in person, with meals to be left outside her room.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Starring Karen Black, Oliver Reed, and Bette Davis, it sees Black’s character suddenly become infatuated with the 19th century garments found within the house, and takes the role of housewife deeply seriously. The chaos definitely gets into same vein as The Shining, even down to the son’s slow crescendo into madness.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>There is however a huge problem with the film which is arguably enough to lower its score: the title doesn’t make any sense. Nothing is burnt, nothing is offered. Other than the elderly mother’s food. Which was definitely not burnt, but well-cooked. Perhaps “Well-Cooked Offerings” just didn’t appeal to audiences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-96.png><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Like most good horror movies, it’s not really about the horror. The social commentary and themes drive Burnt Offerings, with it a commentary on the death of the American family unit. Not far off how King uses horror in many of his works, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-97.png><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Burnt Offerings is currently available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6iqoqS%2FbrTIrKuoqpmWu7R50Z6joq6VYsGpsYyfoKWlXay1qq%2FHZqCnq6Cev6awjKyrnqiYmrtut8innqxlkprAtXnEr5yrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-are-they-now-the-cast-of-step-by-step-html.html><span>←</span><span>Where Are They Now?
