<a href=../../vanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-scandoval-worst-moments-html.html></a>
Practicing nonviolence is a respectable pursuit. It takes discipline, fortitude, and self-control. It also felt totally impossible while watching the 11th season of Vanderpump Rules, because Tom Sandoval sure kept acting like he wanted to get punched. This is not to say I personally want to punch Sandoval. But if someone were to feel such an urge after watching 15 episodes and three reunion specials of him trying to sell himself as a romantic hero after cheating on long-term partner Ariana Madix with their friend Raquel/Rachel Leviss and blowing up the series, well, I would completely understand.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is Charlie Christie?

<a href=../../julio-torres-my-favorite-shapes-review-html.html></a>
Julio Torres on My Favorite Shapes. So often, comedy is about defamiliarization. It’s the gambit that gets loved (and lovingly mocked) in a Seinfeld-esque opening that begins, “So what is the deal with brunch?” It’s the structure underneath less direct jokes like Nate Bargatze’s delightful “dead horse” sequence and the premise that powers Ali Wong’s tweeting about the necessity of hooks in bathroom stalls. The idea is to take some thing that will be widely recognizable to everyone in the audience, and then carefully render that thing alien, surreal, and newly visible so the audience can see exactly how strange and hilarious it is.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>David McCallum's lookalike famous son revealed and he's following in his dad's footsteps</h2><time>Apr 13, 2024</time>
