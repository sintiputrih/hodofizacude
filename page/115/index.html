Trying to live and love,
With a heart that can't be broken,
Is like trying to see the light with eyes that can't be opened.
Yeah, we both carry baggage,
We picked up on our way, so if you love me do it gently,
And I will do the same.We may shine, we may shatter,
We may be picking up the pieces here on after,
We are fragile, we are human,</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Addison Rae Rocks Black Thong Bikini In The Rain Pics Hollywood Life</h2><time>Apr 15, 2024</time>
