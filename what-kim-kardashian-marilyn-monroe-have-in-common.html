It was exactly the reaction she was hoping for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans thought she perfectly summed up the ‘Gilded Glamour' theme for the event. The dress was made available by Ripleys Believe It Or Not, who purchased it in 2016 for $4.8 Million, setting a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guinness World record for the most expensive dress sold at auction</a>.</p><p>Many people were upset for a number of reasons. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Famously worn by the actress when she sang Happy Birthday to President John F. Kennedy for his 45th birthday</a> in 1962, the dress was made by French designer Jean Louis 6 decades ago, and there was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">concern about damage to the iconic garment.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Kim Kardashian's Marilyn Monroe Look From The Met Gala Receive Such Mixed Reaction?</a></span></p><p>The fabric, chosen to exactly match Marilyn’s skin tone, was adorned with thousands of hand-sewn crystals. Marilyn was sewn into the dress to ensure a perfect fit that accentuated her curves and chose not to wear any underwear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The dress caused a sensation as she slipped off her fur coat. Audiences gasped, initially thinking she was naked. It was a move that scandalized much of America.</p><p>The starlet’s version of Happy Birthday has become the most famous in history, and her seductive rendition fueled the rumors that she was having an affair with JFK, despite him being married to Jackie Kennedy.</p><p>Journalists had a field day, referring to Marilyn’s performance as "…making love to the President in the direct view of 40 million Americans."</p><p>It turned out to be one of Monroe’s last public appearances. The actress was dead less than three months later, the result of a sleeping pill overdose. Till today, there are many theories about her death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The connection the dress has to the events of the era means it has a unique story to tell. And historians are horrified that it was allowed to be used as a publicity stunt.</p><h2 id=kim-rsquo-s-tribute-to-marilyn-has-led-to-comparisons-to-the-icon>Kim’s Tribute To Marilyn Has Led To Comparisons To The Icon</h2><p>Of course, Kim's donning of the iconic garment wasn't easy; <a href=#>Kim noted that she "wanted to cry</a>" when she initially tried on the authentic dress and it didn't fit. She had to resort to a crash diet to shed 16 pounds to fit into the dress.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Lost 16 LB In 3 Weeks To Wear A $5 Million Dress For 20 Minutes</a></span></p><p>Marilyn’s measurements were famous, her hourglass figure measured 36-24-34. Kim Kardashian’s are very different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite efforts which included Kardashian spending 14 hours bleaching her hair to the same color as the Some Like It Hot star, Marilyn’s fans say the end result had none of the allure of the original.</p><p>Fashion designer Bob Mackie, who drew the sketch for the original gown while working as an assistant to Jean Louis, has voiced his disapproval. "I thought it was a big mistake," he said. “Marilyn was a goddess… And it was done for her. It was designed for her. Nobody else should be seen in that dress."</p><h2 id=so-how-are-kim-and-marilyn-similar>So How Are Kim And Marilyn Similar?</h2><p>On the surface, there are some distinct similarities between the two women. Both married three times, Marilyn tying the knot to James Dougherty when she was just 16. <a href=#>She went on to marry baseball star Joe DiMaggio</a> in 1954, and writer Arthur Miller in 1956. Kim's marriage history is similar; her marriages were to Damon Thomas in 2000, Kris Humphries in 2011, and Kanye West in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kardashian and <a href=#>Monroe both made an appearance on the cover of Playboy</a>, and both were embroiled in sex scandals. However, the controversies actually helped both their careers.</p><p>The emergence of nude photos Marilyn posed for before she found fame created a massive controversy early in her career.</p><p>Kim hit the headlines when a sex tape featuring her with ex-boyfriend Ray J was leaked in 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=both-knew-how-to-manipulate-publicity>Both Knew How To Manipulate Publicity</h2><p>Despite the negative public reaction to the nude photos, Marilyn's films actually increased in popularity. Kim settled for $5 million from Vivid Entertainment, who she sued for invasion of privacy.</p><p>Marilyn loved to create sensation and was very aware of the response the dress would evoke. An icon of the era, '50s women strove to emulate her platinum blonde curls, red lips, beauty spot, and ‘hourglass’ figure.</p><p>Similarly, in an age where social media drives popularity, Kim Kardashian rules. With over 260 Million followers on Instagram, her fans strive to emulate her lifestyle and her body shape. In essence, like Marilyn, Kim has also changed the ideal body shape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-are-some-huge-differences-between-them>There Are Some Huge Differences Between Them</h2><p>Marilyn fans say much of the legend’s beauty lies in her humanness. Although there are records of plastic surgery on her nose and chin, there is no record of any other changes to her body.</p><p>In contrast, critics say Kim's beauty has been achieved by extreme intervention, and that <a href=#>she's almost unrecognizable from how she looked naturally</a>. For them, Kim is a product of enhancements, fillers, and assistance from editing apps like Photoshop and Face Tune.</p><h2 id=marilyn-achieved-status-despite-her-background-kim-because-of-hers>Marilyn Achieved Status Despite Her Background, Kim Because Of Hers</h2><p>Perhaps the greatest difference between them is their backgrounds. With her mother spending long periods in mental institutions, Marilyn grew up in a number of foster homes, where she was bullied and molested. The starlet never knew who her father was, and her search for him was a constant desire.</p><p>Kim was born into an extremely affluent family, which has traded on the famous Kardashian name. Unlike Marilyn, Kim has never needed to go without anything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite manipulating her sexy image, Monroe was desperate to be seen as more than just a beautiful face and body. Her lifelong struggle to be taken seriously as an actress and to be respected as an intellectual is well documented.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Tragic Truth About Marilyn Monroe's Concealed Intelligence</a></span></p><p>That struggle has been linked to mental health challenges that affected her work and ultimately played a role in her death.</p><p>Critics say this is one of the worst points about Kim stepping into the dress. They argue that Kardashian has completely missed the point, by celebrating the part of Marilyn that she herself so desperately wanted others to see past. For these people, Kim’s appearance in the historic dress was an insult to the memory of Marilyn.</p><p>Marilyn’s allure has extended long after her passing. Even in death, her legend continues, with fans jostling to be buried near the icon. In 2021 a neighboring crypt went on sale for $2 Million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And the dress that caused a scandal 60 years ago has caused another one.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Trying To Stop Second Ray J Tape “At All Costs”</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYriquYykmKuckai1qq3NZqSaqpmhxq95zKilq6eVYrWiwsRmoKdlk6S6rrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elton-john-does-post-super-bowl-carpool-karaoke-watch-w163698.html><span>←</span><span>Elton John Does Post-Super Bowl Carpool Karaoke: Watch!</span></a>
