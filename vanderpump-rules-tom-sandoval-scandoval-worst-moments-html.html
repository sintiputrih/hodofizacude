It takes discipline, fortitude, and self-control. It also felt totally impossible while watching the 11th season of <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>, because Tom Sandoval sure kept acting like he wanted to get punched. This is not to say I personally want to punch Sandoval. But if someone were to feel such an urge after watching 15 episodes and three reunion specials of him trying to <a href=#>sell himself as a romantic hero</a> after cheating on long-term partner Ariana Madix with their friend Raquel/Rachel Leviss and blowing up the series, well, I would completely understand.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ubob00173b81e9hje9iw@published data-word-count=196>Vanderpump Rules’s 11th season was an often messy, frequently unsatisfying experience in <a href=#>fourth-wall-breaking</a> and failed image rehabilitation. As Madix vowed to avoid filming with the man who lied to her for <a href=#>months</a>, slept with Leviss while Madix was out of town for her grandmother’s funeral, and tried to turn the coolest weather phenomena into a <a href=#>symbol of his torrid affair</a>, Vanderpump Rules pivoted to center Sandoval’s desire to be forgiven by his castmates. This mostly involved everyone asking Sandoval to practice some — hell, any — self-awareness and take some responsibility for destroying both his relationship and the show as we know it, and him mostly refusing to do so. The series did its best to make him seem pitiable, but Sandoval undercut that attempt at every turn with his perpetual side-eye, smirk, and volatile temper. This man has <a href=#>Gaston’s</a> chauvinism without any of its accompanying silliness, one-hit wonder <a href=#>Rex Manning’s</a> egoism without the necessary one hit. He is white jeans worn after Labor Day, the candy-necklace string that gets caught in your teeth, a bottle of sour mix left unrefrigerated, and, as Madix said during a production-engineered beach trip, an HR violation waiting to happen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ubr100183b81gdfvsnfl@published data-word-count=31>Lest we end this cursed season with Sandoval thinking he succeeded in winning anyone over, here is a chronological, incomplete list of every time he was just asking to catch hands.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ubuv00193b811kbg966s@published data-word-count=34>1.

Calling Ariana “lazy” for not doing things around the house while he did — the entire evidence of which is footage of one time he emptied the litter box.

His smirking “I still do have friends” toast at his birthday party, attended entirely by randos involved with his band, friend Billie Lee (whom he allegedly <a href=#>isn’t talking to anymore</a>), and a TomTom server who implies he’s tight with the “friend-group” and whom James hilariously dismisses with a “Who the fuck is this guy?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ucj5001f3b81fmpuw1ag@published data-word-count=37>7.

Doing this reborn-martyr baptism pose, in a cold-plunge tub, is so much what people mock about the concept of Los Angeles that I’m surprised no one has yet edited this clip into an episode of <a href=#>Everybody’s in L.A.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ac0/cae/1bfd67749f91901d6e46f4ea8677ac7a6f-Sandoval-Shawshank.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ue23001t3b811ugo4yj9@published data-word-count=100>16. Getting mad other people were making money off the affair, as if this entire show hasn’t been about the Vanderpump Rules cast making money from each other’s miseries, feuds, and infidelities. As Brian Moylan <a href=#>noted</a>, “Lala sold hoodies, Katie has the sandwich shop, Scheana has her little song. Shit, even Sandoval has the continued success of Schwartz & Sandy’s and all of his band’s gigs, not to mention the ‘Dipped Out’ T-shirt he wore in last week’s episode.” Sandoval’s made money off being on the show for years; now he’s just pissed that other people are doing it, too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ue4u001u3b811v1f11xi@published data-word-count=52>17. Did “the entire nation” get way too involved in this affair and its aftermath? Absolutely. But thinking that Lala and Scheana and their podcast appearances are the problem, rather than how unapologetic Sandoval himself seemed in the season-ten reveal episode “#Scandoval” and the reunion episodes, is really the height of delusion.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7uebj001v3b81kdx8fq65@published data-word-count=22>18.

Crying when Scheana says hi to him at the airport on the way to Lake Tahoe, like he didn’t just yell at her in public a few days ago???</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ueh2001x3b81k8ci6wzw@published data-word-count=40>20. Attempting outdoorsman cosplay before the gang goes on a trip to Lake Tahoe … where they stay in a mansion renting for $1,600 a night. Who believes this man can put together a campsite or chop wood?

Claiming he and Raquel/Rachel didn’t have “malicious intent” when they were in their affair … maybe the first time. But seven months of deciding every day to keep lying and keep seeing each other, including when your long-term partner’s grandmother dies? What would be “malicious” under Sandoval’s definition, then? Maybe his insistence that breaking up with Ariana wasn’t “that simple” because she threatened suicide — which would be a pretty crummy thing to share publicly even if he didn’t later try to secure sympathy for his own suicidal ideation — counts?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7uem7001z3b81rdwdt4b7@published data-word-count=42>22. Using the sledgehammer demolition at Lisa’s new restaurant in Lake Tahoe to try and get one over on everyone who mocked and insulted him, and then ignoring Lala’s very reasonable, “How about you hit the wall for your actions, though?” Typical.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ueoq00203b8138rtt3lb@published data-word-count=54>23. Brushing off Brock’s concerns about his team leaking a rumor about Brock and Scheana by insisting “It never fucking happened.” Brock was one of Sandoval’s most consistent defenders this season, and in return he got indignation and defensiveness because Sandoval can’t be bothered to at least pretend to care about his friends’ feelings.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7uerp00213b81m0bc4x01@published data-word-count=52>24. Repeatedly telling his castmates “I didn’t do anything to you,” while also attacking Lala and Scheana for their romantic histories. Bonus punch for every time he tried to make up with a female cast member by complimenting them physically, because apparently there is no other way to communicate with a woman.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ueuf00223b81r7ne1hiw@published data-word-count=17>25. “He said that life is lying”?

Claiming he paid for everything in the house, from toilet paper to pens, and arguing with a producer who asked why he brought this up again. It’s because it’s such a silly hill to die on, dude! And saying of Ariana, “She’s gonna be in for like, a very rude awakening … when she gets her own place,” is the delusional icing on the self-involved cake: Ariana was nearly 30 when they got together and had seemingly lived alone before, I think she knows how to make a Target run!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ufeh00293b814nqsyysw@published data-word-count=30>31.

Saying he was “never so attacking” toward other cast members as they were to him. Thank you to the editors for immediately answering this with a supercut of Sandoval attacking Jax, punching a wall, and yelling at Ariana, Scheana, Katie, Kristen, and Lala over the seasons.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ugj9002k3b81zxsp98co@published data-word-count=49>41. Making the contradictory complaints that his New York Times Magazine profile wasn’t glowing and also that “nobody read it.” If you would like to read Sandoval compare himself with O.J. Simpson and George Floyd in a shaky attempt to describe the media whirlwind around him, <a href=#>here you go</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ugm1002l3b81mr9j982v@published data-word-count=23>42.

When confronted with a montage of all the times he and Katie have fought with each other, responding that “we’re gonna go bang it out.” James, Lala, and Andy all rolled their eyes at this; let me add my name to that list.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ugup002o3b81rp969040@published data-word-count=89>44. Insisting that “This is our job … this is what we do” when Ariana reiterated that she wasn’t emotionally ready to film with him in summer 2023, only three months after the affair became public. Continuously making it seem like Ariana was a disloyal soldier abandoning her post via “Ariana’s rules” rather than someone who did film, just not with him, has at least swayed Lala to Sandoval’s side, but I’m sorry, did a whole season of Vanderpump Rules not still get produced? We all just watched it!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clws7ugzw002p3b81rbwoytx9@published data-word-count=62>45. When Ann served <a href=#>Something About Her</a> sandwiches to the cast in the reunion’s final moments, Sandoval patting her shoulder with an overly friendly “Ann, you can clean up afterward, right? … Just kidding!” was really the toxic cherry on the melting, covered-with-ants sundae that was his arc this season. Ann, sue this man. That’s a storyline <a href=#>for season 12</a>, you’re welcome.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clwhxwn6100000ih9q9gu97of@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Vanderpump Rules Should Have Done This Years Ago</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clin5lxxe00000ih9f7grdjyw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Tragic Zero</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clwkxfabh000k0ih2ylkqgqi1@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>No, This Isn’t the End of Vanderpump Rules</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Tom Sandoval Spent 18 Episodes Asking to Get Punched</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny3rc2dnKuopaK9br7UpZysZaSkum6%2FwKebqK6RoXq0r8Cnm6iukaF6uLvRrKtmpZ%2Bisq%2FA0mefraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./htc-debuts-vive-pro-vr-headset-with-higherres-displays-two-cams-headphones.html><span>←</span><span>Vive Pro VR Headset with Higher-Res Displays, Two Cams, Headphones</span></a>
