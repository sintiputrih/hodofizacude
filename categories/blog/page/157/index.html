Emily Blunt&nbsp;was destined for fashion stardom after&nbsp;stealing nearly every scene&nbsp;in 2006's&nbsp;The Devil Wears Prada, and she's more than earned every bit of praise for her red carpet style ever since. From starring in the action flick&nbsp;Edge of Tomorrow&nbsp;and the suspense thriller&nbsp;A Quiet Place&nbsp;to the feel-good musical&nbsp;Mary Poppins Returns, the actress has tackled almost every type of on-screen role and is just as versatile on the red carpet. Blunt's go-to designers include Michael Kors and Alexander McQueen, but she's also known for&nbsp;wearing whatever inspires her&nbsp;and stylist Jessica Paster the most, which has often involved&nbsp;cutouts, pops of red, and plenty of sparkle.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Megan Thee Stallions Hellraiser Halloween Costume 2021 See Photo Hollywood Life</h2><time>Feb 10, 2024</time>

Megan Thee Stallion is ready to “tear your soul apart,” with her amazing new Halloween costume inspired by the horror classic&nbsp;Hellraiser. Megan shared a video of herself dressed as the iconic villain Pinhead to her Instagram on Sunday October 24. The video showed all sorts of angles of Megan’s sexy take on the horror icon, as an appropriately spooky remix of her song “Don’t Stop” played.
While Megan was clearly inspired by the&nbsp;Hellraiser&nbsp;villain (who is also known as Lead Cenobite and the Hell Priest), who was originally played by Doug Bradley,&nbsp;she was definitely a little easier on the eyes than the movie version.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Watch Meghan Markle's Full Girl Up Leadership Summit 2020 Speech</h2><time>Feb 10, 2024</time>

“There will always be negative voices and sometimes those voices can appear to be outsized, and sometimes they can appear to be painfully loud. You can and will use your own voices to drown out the noise. Because that’s what it is—just noise.”
Those were the rallying words heard by more than 40,000 young people in 172 countries, when they joined Duchess Meghan for a major keynote speech at the virtual 2020 Girl Up Leadership Summit today.</article><article class=post-entry><h2></h2><time>Feb 9, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../deadpool-meta-reference-ryan-reynolds-blade-trinity-comic.html></a>
Ryan Reynolds may be killing it as Deadpool nowadays, but as we all know, his comic book movie career wasn’t always so successful. He initially played Wade Wilson in&nbsp;X-Men Origins: Wolverine,&nbsp;possibly the worst entry in Fox’s X-franchise, and also starred as Hal Jordan in DC’s failed 2011 Green Lantern&nbsp;film. Of course, Reynolds has poked fun at himself in the&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;movies with references to both of these productions. But now, the Merc with a Mouth’s latest comic book appearance goes even further, and calls back to Reynolds’ debut turn in the superhero world that’s often overlooked.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/156/>← Prev Page</a>
