Jayceon Terrell Taylor, widely known as The Game, met a young boy with his first&nbsp;name while strolling down the street on Tuesday.

The town doesn't exist in real life, of course, so where is Midnight, Texas filmed? The supernatural NBC series is shot in a somewhat secluded location with some seriously gorgeous sunsets.
Season 1 of Midnight, Texas was shot in Albuquerque, New Mexico at Albuquerque Studios — which is most famous for Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, but has also housed productions such as Logan, Preacher, The Avengers, and The Lone Ranger.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>AnandTech Storage Bench - Light</h2><time>Jul 20, 2024</time>

Our Light storage test has relatively more sequential accesses and lower queue depths than The Destroyer or the Heavy test, and it's by far the shortest test overall. It's based largely on applications that aren't highly dependent on storage performance, so this is a test more of application launch times and file load times. This test can be seen as the sum of all the little delays in daily usage, but with the idle times trimmed to 25ms it takes less than half an hour to run.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Attamimi Halilintar - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Salary, Height, Facts</h2><time>Jul 20, 2024</time>

Italian seasoning is one of those kitchen basics, like bread crumbs or a simple vinaigrette, that I prefer to make at home instead of buying at the store. I keep all the ingredients in my pantry anyway. I may as well combine them myself instead of picking up an extra spice!

My homemade blend has a mix of sweet, earthy, and aromatic notes that I absolutely love.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo Remember '13 Going On 30'</h2><time>Jul 20, 2024</time>
