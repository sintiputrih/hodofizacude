"In the music game, I'ma tell you the truth, and I'm surprised that nobody sayin' it, 'cause I'ma say it: when you work with Drake... Even when you blessed to work with Drake, if he sends you something, it's unbelievable." He emphasized the word "unbelievable" to suggest that whenever <a href=# rel>Drizzy sends his verse back</a>, it should be met with enthusiasm and praise, regardless what you may think.</p><p>"It's facts, don't fight it," Khaled continued. "The other day I was mixin', 'Yo, how you like the mix,' you know what I'm sayin'? Even if I wanted to turn the high-hat up, even if I thought this needed [something], I like what Drake like! Alright?! Even if this one part sounds—or I thought I could change...'Drake, you like that? I love it!'"</p><p>Khaled added that any rapper or singer who has the chance to work with Drake should <a href=# rel>also see it as a blessing</a>. These remarks have sparked debates about some believing that this behavior simply feeds egos while others argue that when working with artists of a higher caliber, this should be how musicians operate.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">A post shared by DJ Akademiks (@akademiks)</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZoN1fpdmm6Nlm52urbHDZqWerpWneqW10pqeq52VqHq4tdOhZJ2qkaCybr7EoJirnJmjtG651KygnGWZYrmqt8RmrqGZpGK1pnnLoqKeq12jsri%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christy-turlington-net-worth-details-about-earnings-modeling-career.html><span>←</span><span>Christy Turlington Net Worth: Details About Earnings, Modeling, Career - SarkariResult</span></a>
