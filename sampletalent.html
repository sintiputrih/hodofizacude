Born in London, he embarked on a transformative journey as a Hindu monk before merging ancient wisdom with the digital world. His podcast, “On Purpose with Jay Shetty”, tops the charts as the world's leading Health and Wellness podcast with over 35 million monthly downloads and features influential guests such as President Joe Biden, Oprah, Selena Gomez, Kim Kardashian, Tom Holland, and Kobe Bryant. Jay's books, "Think Like A Monk" and "8 Rules of Love" offer profound insights and have topped bestseller lists. To bring these enlightening teachings from "8 Rules of Love" to life, Jay embarked on his first-ever worldwide tour, “Jay Shetty: Love Rules.” Jay's pandemic initiatives and charitable work have made a significant impact. He joined forces with Give India, raising over $5 million in just 24 hours and assisted over 800 students in obtaining educational programming for a year through Pencils of Promise, which led to him being awarded Philanthropist of the Year by Pencils of Promise. Continuing his mission to empower and inspire, Jay co-founded House of 1212—a purpose-driven talent agency representing the world's most influential creators, thought leaders and innovators. Jay has been featured in publications such as Vogue, The New York Times, Harper’s Bazaar, Vanity Fair, Men’s Health and The Wall Street Journal. Additionally, he has made appearances on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, TODAY Show, Good Morning America, The Drew Barrymore Show and Nightline.<br>Jay's mission extends to coaching as the founder of the Jay Shetty Certification School, speaking engagements on behalf of powerhouses like Google, Microsoft, Netflix, HSBC and online courses..<h2 class=tallist_profile_name>How to hire Jay Shetty for an event</h2><p><b>Learn how to hire Jay Shetty or research availability and pricing for booking Jay Shetty to speak at a corporate event, fundraiser, private party, social media campaign, fair or festival, tradeshow or conference, endorsement project, or hire Jay Shetty as a guest speaker, please submit the form to our agency.</b></p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>Frequently Asked Questions about booking Jay Shetty to speak.</h2><p>Many performers, actors, speakers and other talent like Jay Shetty in certain cases will consider virtual appearances via live streaming. They perhaps may accept lower fees too. If you are seriously interested in booking Jay Shetty or other talent shown on our site, we will research their desire and the specific fee for your live-streaming event or project request.</p><p>Jay Shetty's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking Jay Shetty for your party. As long as your funding is commensurate with the price range to book Jay Shetty, CTI will propose your event to the official agency representing Jay Shetty. After we consult with them, we will provide a personal and accurate quote that includes: final costs, availability, and actual interest in being hired for your specific event or party.</p><p>CTI can give you the accurate Jay Shetty booking price once we submit your event details to their camp. "How much does it cost to book Jay Shetty for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Jay Shetty booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Jay Shetty charge for an event. An example fee to book Jay Shetty is in the starting range of $150,000-$299,000. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Jay Shetty for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Jay Shetty agent on your behalf if your funding is in place. By not having funding ready then it will more difficult to book Jay Shetty, because they get many offers to work events that are at or above asking price. It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the Jay Shetty booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired. We do not personally speak for Jay Shetty, but in our experience in booking talent for over 25 years, this is generally the outcome of inadequate funding.</p><p><b>Type</b><br>Speaker</p><p><b>Speaking Topic</b><br>Business</p><p><b>Range</b><br>Internet Related-Internet Personality, Business, Motivational-Leadership, Business-Advertising, Social Issues-Self Help & Relationships, Male, Age Group-18-30's, British, Japanese, Asian, Chinese, Korean-South</p><b>Bookmark and Share</b><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaK4xKerZ6aVqXy0rcypo56skaGyr8COamprcGBkt6LFjKyfnqykrnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fiame-naomi-mataafa.html><span>←</span><span>Fiame Naomi Mataafa- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Husband, Marriage, Ethnicity</span></a>
