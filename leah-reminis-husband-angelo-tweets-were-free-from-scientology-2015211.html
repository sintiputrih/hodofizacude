As was revealed during the 20/20 special, the Church of Scientology <a href=# rel=noopener>hand delivered</a> a packet of “damning” information about Remini to ABC’s offices. In the papers, they claimed that the star was “expelled” from the church for “ethical lapses.” The church also released <a href=# rel=noopener>a lengthy statement</a> about Remini, calling her version of events “revisionist history.”</p><p>“Do they not realize their ‘response’ to the @ABC2020 interview made them look worse?!” one fan noted. “Saying it was ‘stupid.'”</p><p>“It would take a human being with introspection to realize that!” Pagan <a href=# rel=noopener>replied</a> of Scientology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Leah-Reminis-Husband-Angelo-Tweets-Hes-So-Proud-of-His-Wife-Were-Free-at-Last-From-Scientology-3.jpg><p>Remini, meanwhile, <a href=# rel=noopener>has been on the road promoting</a> her new book, Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology, which included a stop by Good Morning America on Monday, Nov. 2. Last Friday, Remini’s former Scientology peer <strong>Katie Holmes </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>released a statement apologizing</a> for her past actions.</p><p>Tearing up as Holmes’ statement <a href=# rel=noopener>was read aloud on Monday</a>, Remini replied: “I’m smiling because it almost makes me want to cry. It makes me emotional because at the time that Katie and this particular crew were writing reports, it cost me a lot of time and pain in my family, being reprogrammed. So at the time I was fighting with her . . . and now I know really what she was going through.”</p><p>However, the Exes star is missing her family. Remini posted a photo of her husband and their daughter, Sofia, on Sunday, Nov. 1. “My troublemakers ;)” she captioned the snap.</p><p>Remini’s memoir, Troublemaker, will be in stores on Tuesday, Nov. 3.
