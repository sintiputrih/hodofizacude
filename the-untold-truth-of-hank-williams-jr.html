He is the son of <a href=#>country music icon Hank Williams Sr.</a> and his five kids are just as talented as them both. Per <a href=#>Taste of Country</a>, Katherine Williams-Dunning and her brother Sam Williams were born to Hank Jr. and his third wife, Mary Jane Thomas. Katherine also has a half sibling named Shelton Hank Williams, or Hank III, from Hank Jr.s' first wife, as well as half sisters Holly and Hilary Williams, who were born to Hank Jr.'s second wife, Becky White.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, Hank Jr. said that music is a family tradition in an interview with the <a href=#>Oklahoman</a>, "Daddy was the original rock star in the family where artists of all genres looked up to him for his writing and singing. It was very hard after he died, because everyone looked at me like (I) was supposed to fill his shoes and be just like him. Mother put me on stage at 8 years old singing daddy's songs, and as I grew older, I realized I needed to do something different."</p><p>The <a href=#>country singer</a> added, "Now as my son and daughter are making their own way in the business, they have [to] create their own sound and identity like I did. Holly performs amazingly acoustic while Shelton goes a bit edgier, but remember, he did all Daddy's stuff early on, too." He is obviously very proud of his kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2lna4B6e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5x5qlpGWnnrmttcCmqmaiomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suki-waterhouse-so-happy-robert-pattinson-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Suki Waterhouse Talks Robert Pattinson Relationship In Interview Hollywood Life</span></a>
