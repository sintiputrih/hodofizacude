Therefore, one of Bliss’ best friends sent out a public announcement to let everyone know what is up. Because she has been contacted by people asking if Bliss is really the one hitting them up for cash.</p><p>Dear People, @AlexaBliss_WWE will never ever ever ever ask you for money! Please DO NOT send anyone saying they are her money. I have had multiple people asking me to confirm phone numbers. But I promise you she will never ask for a dime!</p><p>She continued to say that Alexa Bliss will get upset if someone pays for her $6 pizza so she is not asking fans for money at all. WWE pays Bliss very well and she does not need to ask fans for cash.</p><p>So if someone who is saying that they are Alexa Bliss is attempting to message you, unless she has a blue verified check-mark next to her name it’s simply not her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
