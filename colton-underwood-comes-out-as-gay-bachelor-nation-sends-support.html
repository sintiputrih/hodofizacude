After <a href=#><strong>Colton Underwood</strong></a> <a href=#>came out as gay</a> during an emotional interview on Good Morning America, supportive messages from past contestants on the ABC franchise came pouring in.</p><p>Underwood, 29, opened up about his sexuality in a conversation with <a href=#><strong>Robin Roberts</strong></a>, which aired on Wednesday, April 14. “This year’s been a lot for a lot of people and it’s probably made a lot of people look at themselves in the year and figure out who they are,” he said. “I’ve ran from myself for a long time, <a href=#>I’ve hated myself for a long time</a>. I’m gay. I came to terms with that earlier this year, and the next step in all of this was sort of letting people know. … I’m the happiest and healthiest I’ve ever been in my life. That means the world to me.”</p><p>The Indiana native previously competed on <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a>‘s season 14 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> in 2018 before being named the lead of season 23 of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> the following year. In his 2020 memoir, The First Time: Finding Myself and Looking for Love on Reality TV, Underwood remembered his dad, <a href=#><strong>Scott Underwood</strong></a>, discovering that he might have been questioning his sexuality.</p><p>“He’d pulled up the history of recent Google searches, which included gay porn sites and a variety of questions: Am I gay? How do you know if you’re gay? Why don’t I like having sex with my girlfriend?” Colton wrote. “At first, I denied responsibility. Then I owned up to having been curious. He asked if I wanted to talk about it. I said no, explaining that I’d figured things out on my own. I begged him not to tell Mom. I’m sure he did. But neither of them ever spoke about it with me. All that research, though, led me to understand that I was definitely attracted to girls.”</p><p>After finally coming forward with his truth, the <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> alum said that his family cheered him on wholeheartedly — especially his father.</p><p>“His reaction was sort of … ‘I wish you would have trusted me sooner,'” he said on Wednesday. “He followed it up with, ‘How can I help you? How can I take this off of your plate? Who can I tell?’ To me, that was more meaningful than ‘I love you.’ The only reason I’m here today is because I have the love and support of my family.”</p><p>Colton’s search for love on The Bachelor didn’t end with an engagement, but he walked away from the season with winner<a href=#><strong> Cassie Randolph</strong></a>, who he dated until May 2020. During his GMA interview, the former NFL player <a href=#>admitted that he “made a lot of bad choices”</a> following his split from Randolph, 25, and apologized for “how things ended.” However, he asserted that his connection with the California native was genuine.</p><p>“I loved everything about her and it’s <a href=#>hard for me to articulate</a> exactly what my emotions were in going through that relationship with her was because I obviously had an internal fight going on,” he recalled. “I would just say that I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart. I’m sorry for any pain and emotional stress I caused. I wish that it wouldn’t have happened the way that it did. I wish that I had been courageous enough to fix myself before I broke anybody else.”</p><p>In September 2020, <a href=#>Randolph filed a restraining order</a> against her ex-boyfriend, who she claimed was harassing and stalking her. At the time, the former athlete denied the allegations and the case was later dropped.</p><p>The philanthropist’s Bachelor journey might not have turned out the way he predicted — but <a href=#>he’s still grateful</a> for the experience. “I do think I could have handled it better, I’ll say that,” he admitted on Wednesday. “I just wish I wouldn’t have dragged people into my own mess of figuring out who I was. I genuinely mean that. … At the same time, I can sit here and say I’m sorry to all of those women, I can also say thank you. Without them and without the Bachelor franchise, I don’t know if this would have ever came out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Executive producers from the ABC franchise shared the love on Wednesday, writing in a statement, “We are so inspired by Colton Underwood’s courage to embrace and pursue his authentic self. As firm believers in the power of love, we celebrate Colton’s journey in the LGBTQIA+ community every step of the way.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see how members of <a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> are rallying around Colton after his coming out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLC406ilZq2embKzw86om2abn6KytHnOrqtmmaNitKLFjJuYnKCVobyzec2aq6KnnmLAprrDrGSsraClvLPAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-greene-net-worth-265532.html><span>←</span><span>Brian Greene Net Worth 2024</span></a>
