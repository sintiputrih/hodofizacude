Appalachia has become dangerous after the bombs were dropped in the area due for many reasons. One of the main reasons is that the nuclear fallout has mutated the animals in the area, and it has turned them into monsters.</p><p>One of the many <a href=#>monsters</a> that players will likely run into is the <strong>Grafton Monster</strong>. The Grafton Monster is one of the many monsters players will be tasked to hunt for missions and even sometimes tasked to take a picture of for weekly challenges. Here, we are going to go over where players can find the Grafton Monster in Fallout 76.</p><h2><strong>Grafton Monster Location In Fallout 76</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/I4ECRvqZY4T8oshFYXGQAAS0RPrENTabXbO5A-8W4Ts/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9GYWxsb3V0Xzc2L0dyYWZ0b25fTW9uc3Rlci9mYWxsb3V0Xzc2X2dyYWZ0b25fbW9uc3Rlcl8yX3NpemUucG5n><p>Finding the Grafton Monster in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Fallout 76</a> is actually a lot easier than you might think it is. There are a couple of locations in Appalachia where the Grafton Monster has a <strong>100% spawn rate</strong>. Here are the guaranteed locations for finding the Grafton Monster:</p><ul><li>Charleston Trainyard</li><li>Charleston Capitol Building</li></ul><p>Here are some locations where the Grafton Monster could spawn:</p><ul><li>Hemlock Holes</li><li>Toxic Dried Lakebed</li></ul><p>Just remember, for any of these locations, the Grafton Monster could have been already killed by other players. If you are having trouble finding the Grafton Monster, you should try <strong>server hopping</strong> to hopefully find the Grafton Monster.</p><h3><strong>Is It Worth Hunting Down The Grafton Monster?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/1gBR6dnOOAVa72aAJTuZTKjPOwlUxWeIgqVKXZuLfmc/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9GYWxsb3V0Xzc2L0dyYWZ0b25fTW9uc3Rlci9mYWxsb3V0Xzc2X2dyYWZ0b25fbW9uc3Rlcl8zX3NpemUucG5n><p>There are a couple of reasons why players might want to find and hunt down the Grafton Monster. The first is to complete weekly events. Finding the Grafton Monster could help with weekly or daily tasks, which will give players more SCORE points which will give them even more season rewards.</p><p>Another reason is to get crafting components. The Grafton Monster will drop both <strong>oil and acid</strong>, two important components for crafting. Acid is used to break down materials like steel so they can be crafted into weapons and armor, two very important items in Fallout 76. Oil is used to craft mechanical devices. As you can see, there are plenty of reasons why players might want to go find the Grafton Monster.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/2qTcliBkdQ2tt-IwTfnfNqnLcqX9oyo7hz8UfmwTOtk/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9kYW5pZWxfYm9yamFzLmpwZw alt="Daniel Borjas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3CywKWjqK2kYoR3e8armJ%2Bsn6N6rrvNrKueql2hvKSt06Kmp6s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ariana-grande-2.html><span>←</span><span>Ariana Grande Age, Net Worth, Husband, Family, Height &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
