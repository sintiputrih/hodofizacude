Leakes, 42, snapped at Jones, 48, as the rest of the Apprentice cast — Trump included — were rendered speechless. Later, Leakes took aim at mousy teammate <strong>Hope Dworaczyk</strong>, calling her Jones' "puppet." (Watch a clip of the blowout above)</p><p>Leakes' final zinger to Jones before the teams started work on their task? "Now where's <strong>Barbara Walters</strong>?!" referring to Jones' colleague during her 2000-2006 stint cohosting ABC's The View. "Punk a– bitch!"</p><p>For her part, Jones maintained a level head.</p><p>"This is not the Atlanta Housewives and I was bound and determined to show America how an educated black woman handles stress and how someone who is not educated handles stress," Jones declared after Leakes flew off the handle. "There was a little 'bad Star' whispering in my ear 'Go ahead, let her sink,' but there's a job to do and I was most equipped to get the job done. As long as we're a team, it's not right for me not to offer that skill set."</p><p>Recounting the fiery altercation, country singer contestant <strong>John Rich</strong> summed it up best: "NeNe almost pulled Star's head off and used it as a doorstop."</p><p>In the end, the ladies' team failed to impress Trump and his executives and were sent to the boardroom and it was Dworaczyk who was sent packing. In a surprise twist, last week's eliminated contestant, <strong>La Toya Jackson</strong>, will rejoin the men's team after she met with Trump to defend her firing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Are you on Team NeNe or Team Star?</p><p>By <strong>Allison Corneau</strong> for <a href=#><strong>UsMagazine.com</strong></a>.
