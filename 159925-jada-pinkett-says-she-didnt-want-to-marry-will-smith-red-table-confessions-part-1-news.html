While Will Smith dreamt about heading towards the altar since childhood, Jada never wanted to take part in the institution of marriage. She definitely didn't want a wedding either.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite this initial hesitance, their&nbsp;union was a success. Still, there&nbsp;were&nbsp;some rough times, including Will breaking up with Jada for cursing at him.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out the rest of their story in the video below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhaoZ6fpRmoZqckWK9qrrKnqutZaOWxrR50qGcZpyZmbu1edaapa1lpKR6rq3Rq7Bmr5mhuW6%2FzKKroWWimrFuwMCbo55lk6S7p7HSrKCopqNivaK%2B02ZoZqaVrMA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./floyd-mayweather-yaya-jirah-family-daughters-bad-relationship-jail-prison.html><span>←</span><span>Is Floyd Mayweather Close To His Two Daughters Yaya And Jirah?</span></a>
