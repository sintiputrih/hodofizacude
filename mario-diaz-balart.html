He added:</p><p>“It’s a tricky bug because just when I thought I was over it — or I was pretty close to getting over it — the fever will come back. But … not as bad as it was originally, and I think hopefully the worst is passed.”</p><p>Besides Representatives Díaz-Balart and Ben McAdams, Rand Paul became the first US senator who tested positive for the virus on Sunday.
