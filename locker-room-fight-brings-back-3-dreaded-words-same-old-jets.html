And we thought the circus had left town once Rex Ryan was fired and took his talents to Buffalo. Silly us.</p><p>My formal initiation into Jets World — I missed rah-rah college coach Lou Holtz ordering his Jets to sing a fight song following elusive victories during the ill-fated 1976 season — came after a midweek confrontation with quarterback Richard Todd at the beginning of November 1981, when he grabbed me around the neck and smashed my head into a locker. Looking back, it should be considered an upset that no teammate walloped him after his five-interception nightmare in the 1982 AFC Championship game, better known to Jets fans as the Mud Bowl because Miami coach Don Shula neglected to cover the field during a monsoon, bogging down the speedier Jets.</p><p>On the flight home, erratic behavior by head coach Walt Michaels resulted in his firing.</p><p>Bruce Coslet actually conducted a conference call with beat writers in the press room … from another room in the same facility.</p><p>Coslet was replaced by Pete Carroll, who was sabotaged by Dan Marino’s Fake Spike and was fired after his rookie season because owner Leon Hess lusted after Brooklyn-born Rich Kotite. “A Dese and Dose guy,” Hess called him affectionately. Kotite went 4-28 over two years before announcing: “I wasn’t fired. I didn’t quit. I’m stepping down.” Okaaaaay!</p><p>Not even Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells, who won two Super Bowls with the Giants, could lead the Jets back to the Super Bowl.</p><p>He quit after three seasons, then his hand-picked successor, Bill Belichick, quit after one day as “HC of the NYJ” at a Bizarro World press conference. Belichick, as any long-suffering Jets fan will tell you, has won four Super Bowl rings with the arch-rival Patriots with Tom (Deflategate) Brady.</p><p>And therein lies a big part of the problem. The Jets have been searching for their Next Broadway Joe, or a Brady to call their own, since Namath left them in 1976, long before he wanted to kiss Suzy Kolber on national television.</p><p>Never mind that they drafted Ken O’Brien instead of Hall of Famer Marino in 1983. Mark Sanchez was the anointed savior … before the Thanksgiving night Buttfumble that will live in Jets infamy.</p><p>The last two seasons featured an overmatched GM, John Idzik, with a longer-term vision for the team than Ryan, the coach he inherited.</p><p>And now, your 2015 New York Jets: ’Til Debt Do They Part.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnZ7j3Fmampfobykt8SrZKunn6J6p7XGoatmmqKeu6i%2FjJuYnKNdaHqlvsSam56cXay8s7DSZqqapZVivK2wjKOcratf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./royal-familys-most-candid-quotes-about-their-mental-health-struggles.html><span>←</span><span>Royal Familys Most Candid Quotes About Their Mental Health Struggles</span></a>
