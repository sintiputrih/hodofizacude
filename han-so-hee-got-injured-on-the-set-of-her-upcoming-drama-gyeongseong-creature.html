In reality, the claimed injury looks to be the result of filming one of these sequences. The much-anticipated historical drama takes place in the spring of 1945, at a difficult moment for South Korea. Two young adults fight for survival against the eponymous beast in the period-fantasy drama. Park Seo-Joon also appears in the highly anticipated drama.</p><h2>Fans react quickly as the agency verifies the injury.</h2><p>Han So-hee was hurt in the face during shooting the program, according to the South Korean news agency Sports Chosun on August 3. The actor was subsequently taken to the hospital’s emergency department. According to the same story, the performer injured herself during shooting an action sequence, and the injury’s closeness to her eyes may need surgery.&nbsp;Following the revelation, many of the actor’s admirers flocked to social media to express their worry and wish her a swift recovery.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Han-So-hee-1.jpg alt="Han So-hee" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Soon after, a representative from Han So-agency hee’s 9ato Entertainment allayed some of the fans’ concerns. While the actor had a face injury while shooting Gyeongseong Creature, the agency said that it is not severe and would not need surgery:</p><p>“Han So Hee sustained a face injury while shooting ‘Gyeongseong Creature’ today (August 3). Fortunately, the harm is minor. She isn’t in a position where she needs surgery.”</p><p>They also announced that the filming schedule would continue as scheduled for the time being. The agency, on the other hand, will make certain that Han So-hee has enough rest and recovers fully before continuing with the filming.&nbsp;This is not the first time the actor has been injured while filming an action scene.
