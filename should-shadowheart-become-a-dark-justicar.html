<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Should Shadowheart become a Dark Justicar?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><b>If you let Shadowheart kill the Nightsong, she will go full Dark Justiciar of Shar mode</b>. Be prepared for her to be dark, brooding, and rather evil for the rest of the game. However, she will gain some powerful gear in return, the most impressive of which is the legendary weapon Shar’s Spear of Evening.</p><h2>Should you let Shadowheart do the trials?</h2><p>When she asks, let Shadowheart do it in your stead to earn extra favor with her, if you’d like. This will open the gates and you’ll be able to enter the main trial area. This is a combat trial, so be prepared. It’s also a trial that’s all about using Shadowheart for her Radiant spells.</p><h2>Should I trust Shadowheart?</h2><p>Shadowheart will be determined to kill the Nightsong and become a devoted servant of Lady Shar, so the easiest option is to let her. There’s no fight and Shadowheart will do it with ease, but there are wide-reaching consequences.</p><h2>Does Shadowheart become evil?</h2><p>In reality, Shadowheart’s core is good, but she can be corrupted into evil acts.</p><h2>Should you let Shadowheart pray?</h2><p>At one point in the temple, you’ll come across a statue of Shar, which Shadowheart can pray to. Do not let Shadowheart pray to the statue, as doing so can make her cut off your relationship to fully devote herself to the Dark Lady.</p><h2>What Happens If You Kill The Dark Justiciar Before Meeting Yurgir | Baldur’s Gate 3</h2><h2>What happens if Shadowheart becomes a Dark Justiciar?</h2><p>If you let Shadowheart kill the Nightsong, she will go full Dark Justiciar of Shar mode. Be prepared for her to be dark, brooding, and rather evil for the rest of the game. However, she will gain some powerful gear in return, the most impressive of which is the legendary weapon Shar’s Spear of Evening.</p><h2>Can you still romance Shadowheart if she kills Nightsong?</h2><p>Essentially, Shadowheart will be sent down a dark and somewhat evil path by embracing Shar completely upon killing Nightsong. There are still ways of romancing her further on, even if she mentions she has no time for the player, but it is under different and more gruesome consequences.</p><h2>Why is Shadowheart bad?</h2><p>In Shadowheart’s case, she has some pretty strong feelings against certain races (Githyanki and Tieflings especially) that she isn’t shy about uttering. What’s more, she pretty quickly reveals herself as a cleric of Shar, a goddess that explicitly seeks to destroy order and hope while embracing pain and grief.</p><h2>Can Shadowheart turn to Selune?</h2><p>Save Nightsong – This turns the Spear of Night into Selune’s Spear of Evening and Shadowheart converts to worshipping Selune, leaving her available to romance and changing her appearance.</p><h2>Can you save Shadowhearts parents?</h2><p>You can choose to save Shadowheart’s parents in either path (Shar or Selune). Both paths will lead to the same outcome with this choice: Shadowheart’s parents will be freed and brought to camp to join you for the remainder of the game.</p><h2>Why did Shadowhearts hair turn white?</h2><p>Once Shadowheart comes to terms with her big decision at the end of Act 2, she will learn more about her past and eventually embrace Selûne as the goddess worthy of her devotion. To reflect her newly recovered faith, Shadowheart will then change her hair color from black to silver and get rid of her bangs.</p><h2>Should I let Astarion drink my blood?</h2><p>If you plan to make Astarion a permanent part of your party, you should consider letting him suck your blood for the Happy buff. This buff will add a +1 to all his checks. He will also permanently gain the Vampire Bite action in battle.</p><h2>What is the bad ending of Shadowheart?</h2><p>If Shadowheart kills Karlach at the decisive moment, she will become Absolute. Obviously, this ending is regarded as a bad one.</p><h2>How do you make Shadowheart good?</h2><p>Increase Shadowheart’s Wisdom and Constitution by one point each, to 16 and 18, respectively. This will push both stats up to the next breakpoint, giving her a higher bonus to rolls. You’ll also get a new cantrip of your choosing.</p><h2>Is it possible to free Shadowheart?</h2><p>Use your Illithid power to “Will the pod to open,” which will set Shadowheart free. Once Shadowheart is free, she’ll join your party whether you want her or not – at least for now. With the upcoming boss battle, she’ll be a notable asset to you.</p><h2>Is Shadowheart brainwashed?</h2><p>While Shadowheart is not a Cleric of Selûne, she can convert to her faith after Shar abandons her for sparing the Nightsong. On the other hand, she was in fact brainwashed by the Sharrans, even before she lost her memory in the mission to retrieve the artifact.</p><h2>What is the best subclass for Shadowheart?</h2><p>The Best Subclass for Shadowheart build is Life Clerics because it provides the best overall healing and group utility for a support class. The Life Subclass comes with Heavy Armour Proficiency, Disciple of Life, and Domain Spells. Shadowheart defaults to Trickery, which is similar to this build and can be modified.</p><h2>Can you sleep with Shadowheart in Act 1?</h2><p>Once the conversation with Shadowheart is finished, head for their bedroll. An option to sleep alone or with Shadowheart will appear. If players pick Shadowheart, they will have successfully completed the main romantic scene with Shadowheart in Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><h2>How do I convince Shadowheart to spare Nightsong?</h2><p>“Kill her. Let’s finish this ritual” – Causes Shadowheart to kill Nightsong. “[Persuasion] Don’t do it, Shadowheart. Don’t kill her – you’ll regret it” – You can convince Shadowheart to spare Nightsong.</p><h2>Can you be poly with Shadowheart?</h2><p>Origin companions will never be willing to have polyamorous relationships with each other. They are: Shadowheart.</p><h2>Why do Shadowheart and Lae Zel hate each other?</h2><p>Both had to fight and kill their peers in order to win any amount of conditional love and praise. In short, both are survivors of abuse and have been molded by abusive relationships. And when they’re around each other, what they hate most about themselves is reflected in the other.</p><h2>How to seduce Shadowheart?</h2><p>Players that pursue the Selune route should speak with Shadowheart after exiting the Mausoleum and indicate that she is “not alone.” These fans should then wait for Shadowheart to “change her look,” tell her that they “love it” during a conversion in camp, indicate that they want to talk about their relationship, and …</p><h2>How old is Shadowheart?</h2><p>Based on my understanding, Shadowheart appears to be around 40 years old, Laezel seems to be in the range of 18-21 (excluding dimensional influences), Gale’s age is likely over 30, and Astarion’s age might be over 200 years old, possibly around 240-250 , considering elven aging.</p><h2>Where is Shadowheart if you save her?</h2><p>Once the ship has crashed and you awaken on the beach, you’ll find Shadowheart unconscious just in front of you if you saved her. From there you can ask her to join your party, and she will.</p><h2>Who can you sleep with in bg3?</h2><p>Here are all the characters you can form a romantic attachment with in Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><ul><li>Shadowheart.</li><li>Astarion.</li><li>Wyll.</li><li>Lae’zel.</li><li>Gale.</li><li>Karlach.</li><li>Halsin.</li><li>Minthara.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5wv8eorKWcXai1orDOsJ%2BemaKpeqOxwqiknmWRYrGivspmoa6rpJ6wor6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./obasi-jackson-html.html><span>←</span><span>Obasi Jackson - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
