Buddy Ebsen, who was the initial actor cast as the Tin Man, turned out to be dangerously allergic to the aluminum dust that was used to give the Tin Man his metallic shine.</p><p>Ebsen — who went on to play Jed Clampett on the sitcom "<a href=#>The Beverly Hillbillies</a>" from 1962 to 1971 — had to be hospitalized due to that allergic reaction, and he ultimately had to bow out of the film entirely. However, Ebsen's singing can still be heard during "We're Off To&nbsp;See The Wizard" as his recording made it into the film's soundtrack. As a result of his time as the Tin Man, Esben experienced lifelong health effects and breathing problems, and he never even got the chance to appear on the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Ebsen was replaced by Jack Haley, and the dust was replaced with an aluminum paste that could be painted on, reports <a href=#>ThoughtCo</a>. The paint wasn't without its own problems, though — it gave Haley an eye infection and filming had to be delayed while he recovered. Luckily, Haley was able to keep the job, and he did not appear to have any long-lasting effects from the Tin Man's makeup.</p><p>The Oz costume woes don't stop there, unfortunately. Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion costume had been fashioned out of genuine lion hide which unsurprisingly made it very heavy and hot inside. Coupled with the heat generated by the overhead studio lights, Lahr getting overheated while in character was a legitimate concern (via <a href=#>Dusty Old Thing</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bk21rcXBfnru0rc2eo7JllJa7qLHRqKysZaSdtq%2Bz0maroZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXaS7bsDHnmSsnaRivKd506GcZq%2BZr66zsIyonWanqmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-santa-cant-you-hear-me-live-by-kelly-clarkson-ariana-grande.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Santa, Cant You Hear Me (Live) by Kelly Clarkson &amp;amp; Ariana Grande</span></a>
