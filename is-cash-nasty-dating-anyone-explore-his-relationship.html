<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Is Cash Nasty Dating Anyone | Explore His Relationship</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Cash Nasty is a basketball content creator, and he and his YouTuber girlfriend Ashley divorced, hurting fans’ hearts after a decade of dating.</strong></p><p>However, the YouTuber recently caused a flutter of speculation and discussion when she revealed she had a child with an anonymous lover. So there were whispers about his new girlfriend’s love escapades. Many others are also speculating if his new partner is the mother of his daughter.</p><p>Cash Nasty, a native of Louisiana, went from working at Walmart to being an influencer, specifically a YouTuber and Twitch broadcaster. He gained to notoriety through his energetic and humorous NBA 2K gaming comments. His favorite player is LeBron James.</p><p>As of this writing, Cash, whose full name is Cassius Jeremy Clay, has over 4.45 million followers on his YouTube account CashNasty. His Twitch account (@cashnastygaming) has more than 904K followers. His endeavors outside of gaming include collaborations, vlogs, and presentations on a variety of topics that have reached millions of people. It’s no wonder that he has a vast fan base.</p><h2>Cash Nasty Girlfriend 2023: Is He Dating Anyone?</h2><p>Even though Nasty teased fans about a prospective relationship after splitting up with Ashley in past years, no further information about his new lover was divulged. However, it appears that the YouTuber is gradually opening up about his dating experiences to the rest of the globe. Cash celebrated his 33rd birthday in December 2023 by posting an Instagram carousel of images and videos from his birthday supper.</p><p>As an appealing feminine figure joined him in the celebrations, it appeared to be a birthday dinner and date. Fans were enthralled by his new girlfriend when he stirred interest with a mystery partner. Some assume that the basketball content provider and his new girlfriend (or fiancee) are more than just a couple. However, further details about his connection and girlfriend are unknown.</p><p>In January 2023, Cash posted a YouTube video titled “I Found A New Partner,” in which a woman named Briana Green was featured. Fans imagined she was Nasty’s girlfriend and that the movie would divulge information about their relationship. Bri, contrary to the video title, was Cash’s partner in a House Of Highlights 2 vs. 2 basketball game.</p><p>Cash Nasty posted a video to YouTube titled “Meet My Daughter Ava!” On December 12, 2023, he addressed parenting and introduced his daughter Ava. In the video, the internet sensation stated that becoming a father is “difficult and rewarding” at the same time. It then showed him and his daughter out shopping at a mall.</p><p>Cassius, on the other hand, did not refer to his mother. Rumor has it that the mystery woman who joined him at his birthday dinner is the mother of his child. The confirmation, however, remains.</p><h2>Basketball Content Creator&nbsp; Has a Daughter</h2><p>The American basketball content producer and his then-girlfriend Ashley were one of the most popular internet couples at one point. According to sources, the two began dating in 2007 and were together for a decade until splitting up in 2017. Cash declared their split in February 2017, but later explained on Twitter that everything was a “joke.”</p><p>However, things were already out of hand when they called it quits for good and refused to explain why. When they were together, his fiancée (now ex) Ashley went by the alias AshONasty. They also had a YouTube channel called CashNAshVlogs. It is no longer in service.</p><p>After their divorce, they deleted images of one other from their Instagram profiles. Cash’s YouTube website, on the other hand, still has videos involving his ex-girlfriend, such as one titled “Surprising my girlfriend on her birthday” from May 2017.</p><p>Ashley Dyer was born in Louisiana on May 18, 1991, as was her ex-boyfriend Cash Nasty on December 4, 1990. She is 32 years old, whereas Cash is 33. Ashley is now in a relationship with her current boyfriend, whom she frequently updates on Instagram (@ashmmm18).</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>basketball content creator</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Ian Bairnson | Wife Leila | Family And Net Worth</a></h3>Leila Bairnson is Ian Bairnson's wife.
