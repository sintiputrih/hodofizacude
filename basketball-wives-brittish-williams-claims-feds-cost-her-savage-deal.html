Federal agents alleged that she committed wire fraud, used fake SSNs, and even claimed fake dependants on her taxes</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This shocked fans of the reality star as most believed her to be an entrepreneur, owning a clothing boutique called <a href=# rel=noopener>Love For Labels</a>. Unfortunately, Love for Labels doesn’t seem to be doing well as its earned an F-rating from the Better Business Bureau. Feds allege that because of that Brittish allegedly resorted to committing financial crimes.</span></p><h3>Brittish Says Ankle Monitor Is Costing her Money And Opportunities:</h3><p>After a Missouri judge outfitted her with the unsightly new anklet her lawyer said the device was “significantly hampering her career opportunities and preventing her from being as successful and productive as she might otherwise be,” according to <a href=# rel=noopener>RadarOnline</a>.&nbsp; In translation, the house arrest bracelet is jeopardizing Brittish’s coins.</p><p>“The presence of an ankle monitor creates a significant obstacle that makes it difficult for Ms. Williams to meet her obligations,” her lawyer wrote in a petition to modify her release conditions.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Her lawyer even said that the bulging black box on Brittish’s ankle has caused issues with the filming of Basketballs Wives as “the producers of the show do not want the ankle monitor to be visible. This creates stark limitations on the outfits and costuming that Ms. Williams can utilize. Ms. Williams does not engage in work for which she gets to choose her own outfits and clothes.”&nbsp;</span></p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2022/04/16504012209195.png decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2130343 alt="Basketball Wives" width=700 height=946 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-2130343 class=wp-caption-text>Source: VH1 / Basketball Wives</p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brittish Alleges She Took An “L” &nbsp;On Savage Partnership:</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><a href=# rel=noopener>Radar</a> reports that Brittish stated in her motion that she lost out on a lucrative Savage x Fenty partnership because of the ghastly gadget.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“This lost opportunity cost Ms. Williams&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>at least $30,000</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;with additional payments that would have been available for Instagram appearances and posts” the motion states.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Ms. Williams has also had offers to appear as a model and spokesperson for products by Fashion Nova and Pretty Little Thing Clothing.
