After filming, the two did lots of press together and shared pictures on Instagram together. They were also constantly seen together in public and Holland even met Zendaya's family for dinner in New York City in 2017. This made fans speculate that the relationship was more than the 'friendship' they were making it out to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They shared their first on-screen kiss in Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019 as Peter and MJ.

This quickly added to the rumors and made them even more believable that the two were definitely not just friends.</p><p>At the December premiere for Spider-Man: No Way Home, <a href=#>Tom Holland stopped an interview mid-way</a> so he could watch Zendaya's entrance on the red carpet. Just last week the two were spotted at a Rangers game together along with Euphoria co-star Hunter Schafer and Holland's younger brother. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendaya and Tom sported matching couple jerseys with each other's names on the back</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They were pictured together in Italy just a few days ago.

So while slightly public with their relationship, the two are keeping a lot of aspects of their life together private.</p><p>So while it is unclear the exact date or year Zendaya and Tom Holland started dating, it is quite clear that they finally are opening up about their love for each other.
