However, in order to get a higher amount, you need to provide security. Best Egg also offers different types of loan terms, so you can tailor a loan to your needs. You can’t, however, choose your initial payment date.</p><p>With Best Egg you apply for a personal loan online and receive an answer online, and you submit required documentation electronically. You can also be prequalified before you apply. Best Egg will let you check your loan offers with a <a rel=alternate href=#>soft credit pull</a>, which won’t impact your credit score.</p><p>It’s wise to compare Best Egg to at least two other financial institutions before you make a decision about which one to use for a loan. Here are features to consider that will help you make the best choice for you.</p><h3>Interest rates</h3><p>Annual percentage rates from Best Egg range from 8.99% to 35.99% for unsecured loans. Secured loan rates are between 5.99% and 29.99%.</p><p>In order to qualify for the best rates, you likely need a credit score above 700. Your interest rate will be assigned after you complete the final loan application.</p><h3>How to get approved</h3><p>Best Egg requires a credit score of at least 640 to get approved for a loan. Additionally, the financial institution will verify your identity and income with various documents, such as a driver’s license or passport, and evaluate your debt-to-income ratio (it has to be under 30%). You may need to connect your account to Best Egg in order to have your income verified, or you may need to submit bank account statements.</p><p>Best Egg provides a prequalification process, so you can check potential rates and offers with a soft credit check. In general, Best Egg can offer approval in a matter of minutes and have funds delivered within one to three business days. Some situations might take longer to evaluate, however.</p><h3>Loan types</h3><p>Best Egg lets you access different types of personal loans, including those for:</p><ul><li>Debt consolidation and credit card refinancing</li><li><a rel=alternate href=#>Home improvements</a></li><li>Moving expenses</li><li>Major purchases</li><li>Special occasions and events</li><li>Vacations</li><li>Adoption</li></ul><p>One feature that Best Egg offers for its debt consolidation loan is direct payment to creditors.</p><p>It’s important to note that personal loans usually aren’t eligible to be used as student loans or for <a rel=alternate href=#>student refinancing of debt</a>. Additionally, they aren’t commonly used to purchase a car (auto loans tend to have lower interest rates). Best Egg does offer some secured loans, though, allowing you to get a <a rel=alternate href=#>home equity loan or HELOC</a> with potentially lower rates than those offered by other financial institutions.</p><h3>Loan amount</h3><p>In general, Best Egg loan amounts are between $2,000 and $35,000. However, you may be able to borrow up to $50,000.</p><p>The minimum term for a Best Egg loan is 36 months and the maximum term is 60 months.</p><h3>Charges and penalties</h3><p>Best Egg doesn’t charge prepayment penalties, but it does come with an origination fee. The one-time origination fee is deducted from the amount of funds placed into your account.</p><p>Best Egg also charges a $15 returned payment fee if your check is returned or your bank account has insufficient funds.</p><h2 id=how-best-egg-stacks-up>How Best Egg stacks up</h2><p>When comparing the <a rel=alternate href=#>best personal loans</a>, it’s important to look at multiple financial institutions.
