Like most reality TV shows, episodes are packed with fiery feuds, juicy drama, and more, alongside ripping off the blanket to reveal what really goes on inside a polygamous relationship, presenting to fans that it is not all just fun and games. However, this is the element that keeps many fans hooked, with many wanting to know all the deepest secrets and revelations about the taboo relationship style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, the show has concluded 17 seasons, with the first episode having launched in 2010. The fascinating show features several cast members, including the main man himself, Kody Brown. Kody Brown is arguably the staple that manages to glue the entire family together. However, as many fans have discovered, things haven't always been plain sailing for the family, with some wives even leaving the family altogether — for good.</p><h2 id=robyn-married-kody-in-season-1-of-the-show>Robyn Married Kody In Season 1 Of The Show</h2><p>Over the course of all seventeen seasons, fans have been introduced to an array of different women. One of these women is Robyn Brown, who made her entrance onto the show during its first season in 2010.</p><p>This would make her the first wife to enter the family over the total span of sixteen years. From there, she would go on to meet the other wives: Meri, Janelle, and Christine, alongside their children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly met through a mutual friend</a> and quickly hit it off with one another. The courting period went so well, that just a few months later, she had already moved into the Brown household.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Sister Wives' Robyn Brown Finally Addresses The Rumor That She's Kody's Favorite Wife">Sister Wives' Robyn Brown Finally Addresses The Rumor That She's Kody's Favorite Wife</a></span></p><p>However, things haven't always been plain sailing between Robyn and the other wives. In later seasons, fans would bear witness to growing tension between the wives, but why?</p><h2 id=not-all-the-wives-are-fans-of-robyn>Not All The Wives Are Fans Of Robyn</h2><p>Many fans will of the show will know that the family's relationship has not all been all rainbows and sunshine, particularly in later seasons. Many of the wives began to feel as though there was some preferential treatment or favoritism going on, leading to brewing tension between them all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, <a href=#>some of the wives have even spoken out</a>, and haven't been afraid to vocalize their opinions.</p><p>For Meri, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tensions began brewing when she had to give up her legal status as Kody's wife</a>. This move was made as Kody wanted to legally adopt Robyn's children, however, it came at the sacrifice of rumbling up some negative emotions for his other wife.</p><p>Meri has even previously stated that she has had to 'sacrifice' too much for Robyn, which heavily suggests that she was not happy about the decision.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Will Kody Brown Get New Wives? Current Relationship With Sister Wives, Revealed">Will Kody Brown Get New Wives? Current Relationship With Sister Wives, Revealed</a></span></p><p>Collectively, all the wives have made it clear that they share similar sentiments when it comes to favoritism, and truly believe that Robyn is Kody's favorite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On several occasions, they have all agreed that they feel jealous of Robyn, and even threatened by her. This has consequently made all the wives besides Robyn feel as though they can't all live in harmony together as they did before she was there.</p><p>However, it seems that it is not just the wives that Robyn has upset. Has his sticky relationship with Robyn affected his relationship with his sixteen children?</p><h2 id=robyn-brown-has-a-39-bizzare-39-relationship-with-some-of-kody-39-s-kids>Robyn Brown Has A 'Bizzare' Relationship With Some Of Kody's Kids</h2><p>After witnessing so much turmoil between the wives, fans have been left wondering if Robyn's relationship with Kody has affected any of the children involved.</p><p>In an interview, Paedon Brown, the son of Kody's now-ex-wife Christine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stated that he had always had a 'strange' and 'bizarre' relationship with Robyn Brown</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He noted that this was for several reasons, with one of the reasons including that he saw Robyn's kids doing things with his dad that 'he didn't do with him', suggesting that there were perhaps feelings of jealousy and resentfulness brewing for Paedon.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Does Sister Wives' Kody Brown Financially Support His Three Remaining Wives?">Does Sister Wives' Kody Brown Financially Support His Three Remaining Wives?</a></span></p><p>He continued by explaining that bearing witness to this made him 'rude' towards Robyn's children: “And so, I ended up being rude to them, so she didn’t like me being rude to her kids.”</p><p>However, he also touched on the fact that now, several of these relationships among his step- and half-siblings have since improved.</p><p><a href=#>Many of the other children have also spoken out against polygamous relationships</a>, stating that they would not be interested in pursuing such a relationship in the future. Several of the children have spoken out, arguing that 'their father doesn't spend time with them all equally', with <a href=#>Ysabel Brown even stating that she felt 'abandoned' by her father</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Could this again be a result of Kody's favoritism towards Robyn? Kody seems to deny the allegations that he shows favoritism, but his children clearly feel differently.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmo5%2BZxm6u0aiup2WRo7FutMisZKShlKh6tLXSrZyrZaeew6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sg-lewis-times-influences-guide-pharrell-disco-html.html><span>←</span><span>SG Lewis Is Just Trying to Have a Career Like Pharrells</span></a>
