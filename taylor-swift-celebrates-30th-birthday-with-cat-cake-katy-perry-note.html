That’s very important.”</p><p>The audience then launched into a rendition of “Happy Birthday,” which Swift gushed over. “That was the best song I’ve ever heard,” she told her fans.</p><p>A video montage filled with messages from her friends played too. <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a> was among those who wished the “Style” songstress well. “Hey!
