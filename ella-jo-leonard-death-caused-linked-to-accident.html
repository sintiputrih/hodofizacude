Madalynn Mae Stewart, also 19, was driving a 2017 Chevy Malibu when Ella Jo Leonard, also 19, was a passenger. The car allegedly ran a stop sign at the intersection of Highway 34 and 190th Street, colliding with a 2016 Ford F-350 pickup truck driven by Andy David Merritt, 59.</p><p>In the collision, both cars were nearly broadside and ended up in the north ditch. Ella Jo Leonard suffered serious injuries in the collision and was sent to Methodist Hospital in Des Moines for treatment. Tragically, the third passenger in the car, 19-year-old Halsie Lynn Barnes, died at the site of the incident.</p><p>Tragically, Halsie, a 19-year-old passenger in the car, died at the site of the accident. Both the driver of the Malibu, Madalynn Stewart, and the other passenger, Abigail Dawn Barnes, were hurt in the collision.</p><p>Madalynn Stewart was flown by helicopter to Mercy Hospital in Des Moines, while Abigail Barnes was transported by ambulance to Methodist Hospital. While investigating the reason for the accident, the Iowa State Patrol has warned that some drivers may ignore stop signs, which can lead to tragic collisions like this one. These collisions may be caused by impatience, careless driving, or inattentive driving. In cases such as this, it could be necessary to conduct an independent investigation to protect the rights of the victims and the evidence.</p><p>The disaster has had a devastating effect on the families and loved ones of those involved. Ella Jo Leonard’s injuries have resulted in significant challenges, and she may be able to pursue a personal injury claim based on the findings of the study.</p><h2>Ella Jo Leonard Family: Where Are They From?</h2><p>Regarding Ella’s family, nothing is known about them because they are in mourning over their loss. We can presume that even if we don’t know much about them, they are deeply disturbed by the loss of a loved one. The 59-year-old driver of a 2016 Ford F-350 pickup and the Malibu came to rest in a ditch after their collision.</p><p>Ella Jo Leonard was taken to Methodist Hospital in Des Moines for medical attention after suffering serious injuries in the crash. Unfortunately, she died at the hospital from her injuries despite efforts to save her. Another energetic young person, Tingley resident Halsie Lynn Barnes, 19, also lost her life in the disaster.</p><p>Around 10:30 p.m. on that fateful Friday, a tragic collision claimed the lives of both Halsie and Ella Jo. The close-knit community was deeply affected by the disaster, and the two young people who were taken from them too soon left them in sadness and seeking comfort in each other’s support and treasured memories.</p><p>Halsie Barnes’s passing also left a huge hole in the lives of those who knew her; she was loved for her bright personality, upbeat outlook, and unique relationship with her brothers, for whom she had great affection.
