Recommended Videos The writer and director concocted a convoluted crime caper that left no stone unturned, roped in an insanely stacked cast of recognizable names, pitted them all against each other in a labyrinthine web of double-crossing, twists, turns, revelations, and nonsensical plot points, and then saw the film greeted with a shrug by critics."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
