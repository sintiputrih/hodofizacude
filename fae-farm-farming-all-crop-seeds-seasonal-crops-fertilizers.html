There are two seed vendors in Azoria’s town center:&nbsp;<strong>Willow&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Holly</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fae-Farm-Farming-Guide-4.jpg><ul><li><strong>Willow&nbsp;</strong>sells&nbsp;<strong>tree seeds</strong>, which don’t require a soil bed. Each tree grows only in a particular season. They take&nbsp;<strong>ten waterings to grow</strong>, producing&nbsp;<strong>fruit every six days</strong>&nbsp;after that.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Holly&nbsp;</strong>sells<strong>&nbsp;crop seeds</strong>. Though more will be unlocked as the farming level goes up, all seeds sold by Holly grow in all seasons. She also sells fertilizers to speed up growth, increase harvest numbers, or alter crops.</li></ul><p data-injection=true>Purchase some seeds from Holly and take them back to the farm. After placing them on the soil, it’s time to fertilize (optional) and water the crops.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fae-Farm-Farming-Guide-5.jpg><p data-injection=true>It’s important to know that crops can be watered once a day, and they grow per watering, not per day. If you don’t water the seeds, they won’t wither, but they won’t grow either. As you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">level up the tools</a>, watering will become less of a chore and more fun with fae magic.</p><h2 id=1-farming-tips-and-tricks>Farming Tips and Tricks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fae-Farm-Farming.jpg><p>Here’s some advice to make the farming mechanic much more fun and profitable.</p><ul data-injection=true><li>If you <strong>hold down the power button</strong> and only focus on changing direction, you can water all plants within range.&nbsp;</li><li>When the <strong>watering can</strong> is upgraded to <strong>Iron</strong>, the ability to water a square of <strong>3×3</strong> will be unlocked. Initially, I arranged my crops in a line but quickly rearranged them into 3×3 squares to speed up the watering process.</li><li><strong>Crops can be moved</strong>. If you don’t like your current arrangement, you don’t need to delete everything and lose progress. Open the build menu and walk up to the crop you’d like to move. You’ll need an empty soil bed to place it.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fae-Farm-Farming-Guide-3.jpg><ul data-injection=true><li><strong>Some crops grow faster than others</strong>. Turnips grow in four days, but cauliflower takes eight days to grow. However, all veggies turn into “chopped vegetables” in the cooking station. So, you might want to assess which crops yield higher profits when sold as raw materials instead of refined products.</li><li>Though <strong>beans </strong>take the longest to grow, they <strong>don’t disappear</strong> after they’ve finished growing. Instead, this plant will produce new beans every 4 waterings. It’s better to grow these as soon as the season starts.</li><li><strong>All crops wither when a new season begins.</strong> However, trees stay alive. This means it’s better to grow trees ahead of the season to have them bear fruit four times.</li><li>Besides selling vegetables and fruit, they can also be<strong> turned into more seeds.</strong> I found this particularly profitable with seasonal crops since they can’t be bought from vendors.</li><li>Keep an eye out for <strong>soil beds</strong> that unlock later on in the game. This includes a Hydro soil bed that automatically waters plants and a Fae Soil Bed that lets you grow fae plants.</li></ul><h2 id=2-all-seasonal-crops-and-magic-crop-swap-fertilizer-variants-in-fae-farm>All Seasonal Crops and Magic Crop Swap Fertilizer Variants in Fae Farm</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fae-Farm-Farming-Guide-1.jpg><p data-injection=true>Tired of always looking at the same three crop seeds?&nbsp;<strong>Use the Magic Crop Swap Fertilizer</strong>&nbsp;to turn the all-year-round growing seeds into seasonal crops. This fertilizer can turn beans into pumpkins and potatoes into onions. This is all determined by the time of the season and can be pretty confusing at first, so here’s a chart to make it all clear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Crops-Fae-Farm_13.jpg><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs.
