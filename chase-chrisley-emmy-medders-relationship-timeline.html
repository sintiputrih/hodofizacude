They were spotted spending time together in spring 2022 and by <a href=#>April of that year</a>, photos of the duo together had resurfaced on Medders’ Instagram page. Chase, for his part, confirmed the <a href=#>rekindled romance in May 2022</a> after they vacations in Florida with friends and family.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In October 2022, Chase and Medders announced their engagement after two years of dating.
