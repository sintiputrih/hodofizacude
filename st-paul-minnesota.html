He said at the St. Paul Minnesota Temple <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>groundbreaking</u></a> in 1998 that he had “looked at several sites and felt nothing,” until he came to one “beautiful site heavily wooded with oak trees,” which would become the location of the stake center.</p><p>Nearly 40 years later, the same site he helped choose would be home to the first house of the Lord in Minnesota as well. On Sept. 26, 1998, at <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>the groundbreaking ceremony</u></a> prior to the temple’s construction, Elder Holt said that “the Lord chose this place” for the temple.</p><p>More than 8,000 Latter-day Saints from the temple district gathered to watch Church <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>President Gordon B. Hinckley</u></a> <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>dedicate</u></a> the St. Paul Minnesota Temple on Jan. 9, 2000.</p><p>One of the first patrons who attended the temple on its first day of operation <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>said</u></a>, “I went to the first session, and it was wonderful. Everything went so smoothly. For years, I’ve been saying to my husband that I want to move to Salt Lake City, where I could be close to a temple. Now, I have no excuse to move. I’m 10 minutes away. We’ll stay here.”</p><p><b>Dedicatory prayer excerpt: </b>“We pray for all who shall come as patrons, that they may ever look upon this service as a labor of love performed in the spirit of the Redeemer, who gave His life for all mankind. May the wonder and the majesty of that great act of atonement enter the minds and hearts of all who serve here in behalf of those beyond the veil of death.”</p><p><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><b><u>Read the dedicatory prayer of the St. Paul Minnesota Temple here.</u></b></a></p><h2 class=chronology_title>Timeline of the St. Paul Minnesota Temple</h2><p>July</p><p>29</p><p>1998</p><p>Announced</p><p>A temple for the Minneapolis/St. Paul area in Minnesota was announced by the First Presidency of the Church — at the time consisting of Church <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>President Gordon B.
