As was&nbsp;projected last weekend, NAV's&nbsp;Demons Protected By Angels album missed out on the Billboard 200's No. 1 spot, instead landing just below it at No. 2 after selling 67K album equivalent units during its first week out.
It was initially reported that the Toronto-born rapper might even have been pushed out of the top two if Ozzy Osbourne's&nbsp;Patient Number 9 project drew in more attraction.&nbsp;HDD anticipated that NAV would move anywhere from 50K to 55K copies, but he clearly pulled through and managed to beat the expectation.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>NeNe Leakes Trashes Star Jones in Vicious Apprentice Catfight</h2><time>Jul 18, 2024</time>
