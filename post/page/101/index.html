Country music legend Lee Greenwood has denied Jason Aldean is a racist and has slammed the controversy around Aldean's new hit song 'Try That in a Small Town'.&nbsp;

Speaking to Fox News, Greenwood has now supported the singer during the ongoing backlash, saying he is 'the biggest patriot' and that it is a 'great song'.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fat Joe Said Rappers Were Scared To Rap Alongside Big Pun</h2><time>May 6, 2024</time>

Janelle Monáe doesn’t make albums. She builds worlds. At the outset, you’re swept up in a whirlwind of quirky characters and unique topography, and briefed on the overarching social order that connects them. Monáe is a formidable actor, dancer, and singer-songwriter with a sci-fi heart. Her music has often used robotics allegories to unpack present-day trauma, weaponizing extraordinary machines to extract truths about the human condition, just as Yoshiyuki Tomino’s Mobile Suit Gundam, Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, and Isaac Asimov’s I, Robot play with house ethics and morality beneath the glint of precious metals.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Stephen Sondheim: London Theaters to Pay Tribute by Dimming Lights</h2><time>May 6, 2024</time>
