You made everything better. My sweetest, beautiful girl. My best friend. Oh how much I love you. What a gift it is to love you. I love you forever and ever, Mom. ❤️.”</p><p>Friends and fans expressed their condolences in the comments section, including Kaitlyn’s Booksmart costar <strong>Beanie Feldstein</strong>, who wrote, “I love you and your family with every ounce of my soul, my pup.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Riley Keough</strong> added, “Lots of love to you and your family ❤️,” while <strong>Maude Apatow</strong> wrote, “Sending you so much love ❤️ I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Kathy was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 39. Kaitlyn detailed her mom’s “terrifying” health battle in an October 2020 <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram post</a>. “Some days are so so scary that I don’t even know how to feel anymore, and other days she has a positive appointment and then it’s a gooood day❤️,” she wrote at the time. “Every day is different and we’ve gotten through it together as a family. She is the strongest woman I know and every day I am grateful for the doctors that have taken such good care of her over the years.”</p><p>Kaitlyn’s message was written during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. “Cancer is so unbearably scary,” she added at the time. “I can’t even begin to imagine what it’s like to live with this disease but I do know what it’s like to watch someone you love go through the pain. My heart is with anyone [who] has to deal with the burden that is cancer. Let’s get checked and encourage those we love to get checked as well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZmpubq6jJ2cr52iYrqwwdGnqmaln6J6rK3TobCsZZSarrW0jJqdrZ2iYrCiusKeqWaakanBrbGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-gift-sets-2023-editors-picks-8399682.html><span>←</span><span>Ive Spent Months Reviewing Holiday Gift Sets and These Are the Top 12</span></a>
