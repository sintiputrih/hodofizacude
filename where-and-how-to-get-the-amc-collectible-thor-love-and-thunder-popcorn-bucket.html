It sees Thor trying to find his place in the world. However, he soon finds himself fighting with Gorr the God Butcher, a man who plans to take Thor and Thor’s ex-girlfriend Jane Foster down at any cost as part of his plan to eradicate all gods.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-how-do-you-get-the-thor-love-and-thunder-popcorn-bucket data-injectable=false>How do you get the ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ popcorn bucket?</h3><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>The bucket itself was unveiled at CinemaCon in April. On June 12 AMC posted a video to TikTok and Twitter showing off the buckets with the caption “#ThorLoveandThunder tins are coming to #AMCTheatres July 8th!”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#ThorLoveandThunder</a> tins are coming to <a href=#>#AMCTheatres</a> July 8th! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eAHZXsRjQH</a></p>— AMC Theatres (@AMCTheatres) <a href=#>June 13, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>The hype only increased when user jllo30 posted a TikTok video showing a closer look at the buckets, with some users presuming that this person must be an AMC employee due to the timing and background of the video, which seems to be an empty AMC theater.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true><a title=@jllo30 href=#>@jllo30</a><p>AMC theaters popcorn bucket <a title=thorloveandthunder href=#>#thorloveandthunder</a> <a title=movie href=#>#movie</a> <a title=marvel href=#>#marvel</a> <a title=jonathan href=#>#jonathan</a></p><a title="♬ Thor: Love and Thunder Teaser Trailer Music - Sweet Child O' Mine (Thor: Love and Thunder Soundtrack) - Sh4d0wStrider" href=#>♬ Thor: Love and Thunder Teaser Trailer Music – Sweet Child O’ Mine (Thor: Love and Thunder Soundtrack) – Sh4d0wStrider</a></figure><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>However, purchase information and price haven’t been revealed at the current time. This isn’t that unusual, as AMC didn’t officially announce the&nbsp;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&nbsp;tie-in bucket price until a few days before the film arrived in cinemas, suggesting the company likes to use these announcements as part of their final promotional pushes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Conjure up your cravings with the Doctor Strange collectible popcorn vessel.

Fans simply had to go to their local AMC theater’s concessions stand and purchase it like they would their usual popcorn.&nbsp;It should be noted that fans on Reddit note that these buckets sell out quickly, and the number at each venue gets varies. If jllo30 is to be believed, they said their AMC only received 24 of the buckets, so fans might be disappointed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>MysteriousVariant’s comment from discussion "’Thor: Love & Thunder’ Popcorn Bucket"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>This is backed up by comments underneath the Doctor Strange promotional tweet, where many moviegoers complained about how quickly the buckets sold out at their local theater.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yall needed to be super stocked on these!

If you want one, you have to hope your theater has some left when you arrive. However, some Reddit users have noted that they have previously been able to buy the bucket without having a ticket to the associated movie simply by going and asking at the concessions stand. But this might depend on your local AMC theater’s policy.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Kory568’s comment from discussion "’Thor: Love & Thunder’ Popcorn Bucket"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=false>The&nbsp;Doctor Strange&nbsp;popcorn bucket was $24.99, including popcorn. So it is likely that this&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;bucket will be around the same price point. In their video, jllo30 said the bucket and popcorn were $39.99, a price which many internet rumors seem to be agreeing on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdopp6orrDZp%2Bor12pvG6zxK1kraCVYq6ur4ycpqWklZjBqq7LnmStoJ%2Bneq271Z5kmqaUYsGpwc2dnKtloKS9pLvRp2SbrZOgsrV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-ben-simmons.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Ben Simmons?</span></a>
