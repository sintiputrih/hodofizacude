Even though her exact date of birth isn’t known, Amelia revealed this in a particular Chicken Shop Date she had with Central Cee.</p><p>Central Cee asked Amelia how old her sister was, to which she replied: “Year below me.” Currently, Amelia Dimoldenberg is 30 years old therefore, Zoe Dimoldenberg is 29 years old in 2023.</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FBRSiDK7Uo</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Azh1WpQtNC</a></p><p>— Zoë (@zoedora) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">December 23, 2020</a></p><h3><strong>She was born in Westminster, England</strong></h3><p>Amelia Dimoldenberg was born to Paul Dimoldenberg and Linda Dimoldenberg in Westminster, England. She grew up in Marylebone in the City of Westminster and attended St Marylebone School alongside her elder sister. Zoe and Amelia are the only children of their parents.</p><p>So far, nothing has been revealed concerning Zoe Dimoldenberg’s further studies. However, it’s widely known that Amelia, her sister, studied A-levels in English, art, politics, and IT, and went on to obtain a Foundation Diploma in Art and Design and a BA in Fashion Communication from Central Saint Martins, London.</p><h2><b>What Does Zoe Dimoldenberg Do For A Living?</b></h2><p>A major part of Zoe Dimoldenberg’s life is off social media, therefore no one knows her current occupation except people in her close circle.</p><h2><b>Is Zoe Dimoldenberg Married?</b></h2><p>No, Zoe is not married yet. Although not much is known about her past relationships we can deduce she’s single from Amelia’s discussion with Central Cee in a particular episode of Chicken Shop Date. As stated earlier, Central Cee first asked Amelia for Zoe Dimoldenberg’s age. He then continues the conversation by casually asking if she has a boyfriend, clearly trying to pursue her sibling, but Amelia shut it down immediately.</p><p>“Why are you interested? You can’t be,” she said before asking the musician, whose real name is Oakley Neil H. T. Caesar-Su if he had met her sister. “Never met her,” he replied as Amelia hilariously quipped back: “No she’s not interested in you.”</p><p>The 53-year-old rapper continued shooting his shot and asked what her “type” is – but the host simply said: “Not you. She would not go on a date with you.” “We’re on a date, so can you stop trying to go on a date with my sister,” Amelia Dimoldenberg concluded.</p><p>Furthermore, not much can be said concerning the supposed relationship she had with Big Smoke, a movie designer, artist, and DJ. This was the whole scenario that brought Zoe Dimoldenberg into the limelight as Amelia Dimoldenberg’s sister, after Amelia retweeted Big Smoke’s tweet with a picture of Zoe on February 20, 2018. Saying “That’s my sister wtf @zoedora’</p><p lang=qme dir=ltr>🐩 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dfQiz7kD8V</a></p><p>— Big Smoke – (@Skepta) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2018</a></p><p>Zoe Dimoldenberg is undoubtedly Amelia’s sister, their resemblance and the viral tweet confirms it. However, unlike her, she is very secretive on and off social media and her Twitter banner says it all it goes thus ‘trust no one in this cyber world’. Apparently, she is a different kind of person from her sister even though they share a couple of things in common.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecCmnKWhkWKxqrnOpZueppKav6i%2FjKygrKyVp3q7u8Rmm6Kln6GxprrBnqmgZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shelby-miller.html><span>←</span><span>Shelby Miller- Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Dating</span></a>
