We recently partnered with&nbsp;the North Carolina Sweet Potato Commission&nbsp;to create videos about one of my favorite foods – the sweet potato.

After some morning blog reading, I’ve suddenly realized that everyone else has gone (and come back from!)&nbsp;a summer vacation and we somehow forgot to plan one of our own. We’ve been talking about&nbsp;a number of trip ideas since last winter but that’s just the problem – it’s been all talk. Talk followed by excuses, followed by projects and general life busy-ness. So… help? What would be a fun trip for&nbsp;late August/early September? I’m drawing a blank and would love some suggestions. It could be near or far… preferably with temps less than…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Oh zucchini, let me count the ways… julienned, coined, grilled, sauteéd, stuffed, kabob-ed, gratin-ed,&nbsp;muffin-ed, pancake-d… (I know I’m missing a few)… Right now, my zucchini method of choice is the simple&nbsp;ribbon. Just raw. Tossed into salads. I mean, how pretty are they? (Also – how pretty are those plates!?) I very often make corn recipes where frozen corn will suffice – but not this time. This is the time of year&nbsp;where my midwestern roots shine through and I say – you need to get your hands on some fresh corn. And then don’t cook it too much. I grilled my…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Panzanella: it’s your excuse to eat bread and call it salad! I’ve veggie’d up the classic tomato-basil panzanella with blistered sweet peppers, tangy pickled onions, and just few torn kale leaves. It all starts with that stale bread that’s sitting on your kitchen counter. In our household of just 2 (people, that is – the dogs are paleo), we have&nbsp;stale bread around pretty often. These&nbsp;were the last bits of a&nbsp;rustic miche round&nbsp;from my favorite bread source,&nbsp;Easy Tiger. I just realized I labeled them as “day old,” but these scraps were actually&nbsp;many days old. Perfect panzanella bread. This would be a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I don’t know if it’s possible to have too many cherry tomatoes. But if you do, roasting them is the perfect way to eat a whole bunch at a time. They shrivel up into the sweetest, tangiest&nbsp;little bites – which are perfect to toss into simple bowls&nbsp;full of greens and grains. Around this time last year I posted this slow roasted tomato pasta. This year, I’m cheating the slow roast. Here’s how: 1. Use little tomatoes and it’ll go tons faster. 2. Start roasting them in&nbsp;low heat (like you’re supposed to). Once they begin&nbsp;to dry (and&nbsp;your impatience rises), raise the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I first made this orzo salad recipe at my mom’s house. When I dug through her fridge, I found crunchy veggies, summer herbs, and a big, juicy mango that I absolutely had to use. I caught sight of a box of orzo pasta and a can of chickpeas in her pantry, and I immediately thought – orzo salad! It would be hearty enough to serve for dinner, but light and refreshing for the heat wave that was happening that night. I tossed together crunchy cucumbers, red onion, fresh herbs, and mango and dished it up for my family. While we…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>And the season of simple recipes continues… “What are you going to do with these?” asked the farm-stand man as I was fixating on these 3 gorgeous golden tomatoes. This question always flusters me… I should have an answer, but truthfully, I buy things on a whim and usually decide what to make later. And in this case, these tomatoes were so spectacular that knew I wasn’t going to “do” much. “Um… I’m probably just going to slice and eat them…” He looked at me with a huge grin as if I had just given the right answer. I could…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I have a confession to make: I’m obsessed with feta cheese. Growing up, my mom used to make spanakopita, (carefully wrapped phillo dough triangles stuffed with spinach and feta), every year for my birthday – it was my favorite thing and that tangy creamy flavor is still one of my fondest food memories. Of course, that’s a lot of work to do for every day meals, so nowadays I get my feta fix on salads. That tangy salty bite has a way of turning on-hand ingredients into tasty cohesive meals. Sweet potato and pomegranate, watermelon and avocado, strawberries and quinoa,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’ll never get tired of an arugula salad with avocado and quinoa. They’re probably my favorite three ingredients to use. I love this sweet combo of dried apricots, peppery arugula, smoky cumin, and fruity Arbequina Olive Oil. (I almost named this Arbequina Quinoa – but try to say that one five times fast). The Key to a Good Arugula Salad is a Good Dressing The cumin-spiced salad dressing really makes this salad shine, and its key ingredient is Arbequina Olive Oil. So what’s Arbequina Olive Oil? It’s a light and fruity extra-virgin olive oil that’s perfect for flavorful dressings like…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Lately, our weekends have been filled with some pretty extravagant eats. After a few weeks in a row of food & wine fests, gelato fests (oh, yes), and dinners out with friends, I’ve been feeling a little over-indulged, to say the least. Quinoa to the rescue! Nothing helps me feel more grounded than a bowl of quinoa piled with veggies. This bowl is pretty simple if you’ve prepped a few of these items in advance. I like to make a big batch of quinoa and keep it in the fridge all week. Same with pesto… and this week I happened…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Oh, kohlrabi… I first learned of this alien vegetable years ago when I received my very first CSA box. At the time, I wasn’t adventurous with vegetables, so I had no clue what it was and no clue what to do with it. Kohlrabi has seemed to gain some popularity since then – I often see it on restaurant menus – but back then it was barely google-able. Fast forward to now – it’s one of my favorites. People say it’s similar to broccoli stems, but I think it’s closer to daikon or even jicama. Slice it up into sticks,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnopqwqrzEZqCnnJWterO7zq1mpp2RoXy0rcuam2iokZyycH2WaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rebecca-black-ethnicity-nationality-race-family-body-measurements-career-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rebecca Black Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Family, Body measurements, career</span></a>
