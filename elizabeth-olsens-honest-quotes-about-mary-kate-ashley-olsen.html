I don’t even run lines with my roommates,” the&nbsp;<i>Liberal Arts&nbsp;</i>star told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>at the time. “I think that’s like an idea the world has of [us] or something. But no, I’m not standing around running lines with my sisters.”</p><p class=p1>Mary-Kate and Ashley rose to fame playing Michelle Tanner on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Full House </i></a>from 1987 to 1995.

The latter brand — which <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;</i>star wore at the 2021 Emmys</a> — is named for Elizabeth and their brother, <strong>James Trent Olsen</strong>, and <a href=#>further showcases their familial bond</a>.</p><p class=p1>“People should feel more strong as women now more than ever,” Elizabeth <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;and other reporters in October 2017</a> of growing up as the twins’ little sister. “The thing that I’ve been trying to wrap around my head is, like, at what point did my parents make me feel like a very strong female? I don’t really know how that happened but I always felt like a very empowered young female and it’s something that my sisters and I try to figure out.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Sorry For Your Loss&nbsp;</i>alum added that <a href=#>the trio “always felt pretty empowered”</a> and were “raised” to “do the same for our [future] children moving forward.”</p><p class=p1>While the fashion entrepreneurs have <a href=#>kept their lives relatively private</a> since their days as child stars, Elizabeth isn’t shy when it comes to gushing over her older sisters.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I always felt that having older twin sisters was an advantage,” the MCU star — who <a href=#>married <strong>Robbie Arnett</strong> in 2020</a> — told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar&nbsp;UK</a> </i>in a May 2022 profile. “I felt very clear about how I was going to navigate lots of things because of watching them. I also felt very protected. There’s something that I’ll never experience [in their twin] connection, but I feel lucky to be witness to it.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below for more of Elizabeth’s quotes about her sisters:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksq212ZqZnqyYYrytv8Snqmagn6OytMCMqqyorJWoeqKuzq6rZqWRp8Zut8CtnGaZo525psWMqKOsnZ5k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./142530-cargo-200-ukraines-grim-search-fallen.html><span>←</span><span>'Cargo 200': Ukraine's grim search for its fallen</span></a>
