His true height as an adult remains debatable, but numbers have ranged from 7’7″ to 8’6″.</p><p>The reason why he was so shockingly tall was that he had a condition known as acromegalic gigantism. And while his height could be advantageous for him in some situations, it was downright dangerous in others.</p><p>Earle had been a Hollywood actor (appearing in films like Hansel and Gretel and Jack and the Beanstalk) before a fall from scaffolding <a href=# rel=noopener>led to major injuries</a>, causing his retirement from the movie industry.</p><p>Soon after his accident, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus freak show came through town with Jim Tarver as their current traveling “giant.” Earle was considerably taller than Tarver, and Ringling Bros., seeing an opportunity, offered Earle a one-year contract with the circus.</p><p>Years before, Earle had said that he never wanted to be in a freak show. But he needed to make a living, so he decided to sign the contract.</p><p>Earle was initially apprehensive. But on his first day, he was put at ease when a performer with dwarfism named Harry Doll explained that there were more “freaks” in the audience than there were in the sideshow.</p><p>The gentle giant began his Ringling Bros. career alongside 2’2″ tall Major Mite (Clarence Chesterfield Howerton). He would spend the next 14 years on the road with the sideshow — often posing alongside extremely short men or average-sized men to further emphasize his height.</p><p>After retiring, Earle went on to become a traveling salesman for the Roma Wine Company. He died of kidney failure in 1952 at the age of 46.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonynvsSaomarmKTEbrnEppmeqqNkfw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-caycee-black-from-project-runway-meet-the-designer-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Caycee Black From Project Runway?
