Zapata said that while on a date one week after their wedding, he asked Snyder whether she was “feeling this,” to which she said no.</p><p>“I was so mad at her after that because I thought we were really going to try,” Zapata said on the reunion. “I was so upset I just walked out and I just didn’t talk to her for a year.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Izzy-Zapata-Reveals-New-Girlfriend-1-Year-After-Stacy-Snyder-Breakup-2.jpg><p>Snyder added, “I felt like we needed to start over and I feel like you were like, ‘If we’re starting over, going backwards, I don’t want to do it.”</p><p>After officially ending their relationship, they reconnected a year later after a chance run-in at a bar. Zapata said that they ended up kissing, but ultimately decided it was best to not continue dating.</p><p>“We appreciated more just having each other back in each other’s lives and our friends.” he shared. “We’re bros.”</p><p>Throughout their time on Love Is Blind, Snyder struggled to accept Zapata’s financial situation and famously criticized his use of paper plates when she saw his apartment for the first time. In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight, </a>Snyder explained that her reservations weren’t only tied to finances.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It was him not being able to really describe his job. [It] was a brand-new job. He couldn’t disclose to me how he made money, how much he made,” she told the outlet. “The whole thing just seemed very question mark. And it was concerning that he was looking at me like it wasn’t a big deal. That’s a huge deal.”</p><p>For her part, Snyder opted not to confirm her current relationship status at the reunion, replying “no comment” when asked by hosts <strong><a href=#>Nick </a></strong><a href=#>and</a><strong><a href=#> Vanessa Lachey</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVitrR5waWgp5yjYra7xthmoKesoqSxtq%2FErGSnnaditKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqistOeqWarpJawunnSqaOirF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-temu-a-scam.html><span>←</span><span>Is Temu a Scam?
