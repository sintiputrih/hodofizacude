<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Mario Batali Bio, Wife, Net worth, Family, Where is he, what is he up to now</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Mario Batali belongs to the exclusive club ofchefs who have managed to turn their culinary skills into prominent personalities.&nbsp;Batali, also a restaurateur, author, and TV personality, once sat on an empire that consisted of multiple restaurants, cooking shows, and best-selling books.&nbsp;However, all of this collapsed in 2017 when Batali was accused of sexually assaulting and molesting multiple women.&nbsp;So where is he now and what is he up to?&nbsp;The answers and more are given below.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Mario Batali Bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>In Seattle, Washington on the 19&nbsp;</span><span>th</span><span>&nbsp;day of September 1960 Mario Francesco Batali was born.&nbsp;His father’s name is Armandino Batali while his mother’s name is Marilyn.&nbsp;His mother is French and Canadian, and his father is Italian.&nbsp;Batali first developed an interest in cooking due to the influence of his family.&nbsp;Anyone who knows anything about Italian families will know that mealtimes are a big deal for them.&nbsp;The Batali family, both immediate and extended, was no different.</span></p><p><span>Mario Batali was educated in Spain before returning to the US and studying at Rutgers University New Jersey.&nbsp;In college he studied Spanish theatre.&nbsp;He also worked as a chef in a sandwich shop.&nbsp;After graduating, Batali attended a culinary school in London known as Le Cordon Bleu.&nbsp;However, he was not satisfied with his studies.&nbsp;He had wanted practical training and was cooking under the guidance of the renowned chef Marco Pierre White.</span></p><p><span>Batali later moved to Borgo Capanna, a small Italian village, where he studied the art of traditional Italian cooking.&nbsp;After three years in Italy, Mario Batali returned to the United States in 1993.&nbsp;Together with Stephen Crane they founded a small Italian restaurant called Po.</span></p><p><span>After five successful years at Po, Bataliin partnered with famed restaurateur Joe Bastianich.&nbsp;They founded the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, under which they established several successful restaurants.&nbsp;Her very first restaurant was Babbo Ristorante e Enoteca in New York.&nbsp;They opened it in 1998 and it was named Best New Restaurant that same year.&nbsp;The restaurant now has a Michelin star.</span></p><h2><strong><span>wife and family</span></strong></h2><p><span>The renowned chef is married to Susi Cahn.&nbsp;Susi is the daughter of Miles and Lilian Cahn.&nbsp;Her parents founded the popular Coach handbag brand.&nbsp;The brand was loved for its trendy but practical bags.&nbsp;The Cahns sold their fashion brand in 1985 and are now engaged in the production of goat cheese.</span></p><p><span>Batali and Cahn met at a food event in New York in 1992.&nbsp;His wife had come to represent her family’s goat cheese company.&nbsp;They later began dating and married in the Caribbean in 1994.</span></p><p><span>The couple have two children together.&nbsp;They are Leo (born 1996) and Beno (born 1999).&nbsp;The children follow in their father’s footsteps.&nbsp;They already have a cookbook to their name.&nbsp;The book, entitled&nbsp;</span><span>The Batali Brothers Cookbook</span><span>&nbsp;, hit shelves in May 2013.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Batali ranks among the richest chefs in the world with a net worth of $25 million.&nbsp;In addition to its restaurants, Batali also has a stake in the Eataly chain in the United States.&nbsp;Eataly is a franchise business consisting of a grocery store and a restaurant under one roof.&nbsp;The first outpost opened in Chicago in 2010.</span></p><p><span>Another real source of income for the cook is TV shows and books.&nbsp;Batali’s first TV show was called Molto Mario.&nbsp;On the show, Batali cooked for the guests and told them interesting stories about Italian food.&nbsp;The show ran from 1996 to 2004.</span></p><p><span>Other television shows of his include&nbsp;</span><span>Iron Chef America</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>Ciao America</span><span>&nbsp;, and&nbsp;</span><span>The Chew Toy</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Batali has also authored no fewer than 11 cookbooks.&nbsp;These include the award-winning&nbsp;</span><span>Molto Italiano: 327 Easy Italian Recipes</span><span>&nbsp;(2005) and the NYT best-selling&nbsp;</span><span>Mario Batali Italian Grill</span><span>&nbsp;(2008).&nbsp;He must have earned significant royalties from these books.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where is he and what is he doing now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>In December 2017, several women made allegations of sexual assault on Batali.&nbsp;The allegations were made public on the popular food industry website, Eater.&nbsp;Some of the accusers were women who had worked for him, while others were random people.&nbsp;Most of them accused him of aggressively groping them.&nbsp;At least two accused him of drugging and assaulting them.</span></p><p><span>The chef apologized but the scandal made him a pariah in the food industry.&nbsp;It led to the cancellation of his television shows.&nbsp;He was also forced to sell his stake in the B&B group.&nbsp;Mario Batali has kept a low profile since that scandal.&nbsp;He previously lived in New York but now resides at his family’s summer home in Grand Traverse Bay, Northport Michigan.&nbsp;Batali is also trying to clean up its image.&nbsp;He has volunteered to offer cooking classes to refugees in countries like Rwanda, Iraq and Greece.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
