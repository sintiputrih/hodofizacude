A high school senior, Pip Fitz-Amobi (<strong>Emma Myers</strong>), takes an interest in the case and thinks there’s more to the original story so she sets out on an investigation of her own.</p><p>In addition to Meyers, who also stars in Netflix’s Wednesday, the mystery series is set to feature <strong>Zain Iqbal, Jude Collie, Raiko Gohara, Yali Topol Margalith, India Lillie Davies, Asha Banks, Jude Morgan-Collie, Yasmin Al-Khudhairi, Henry Ashton, Orla Hilla, Carla Woodcock, Anna Maxwell Martin, Matthew Baynton, Jessica Webber, Gary Beadle, Adam Astill</strong> and Annabel Mullion.</p><p>In an interview with Netflix’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Tudum</a> published on Monday, April 22, Meyers, 22, shared that she was “thrilled” to be starring in A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder.</p><p>“Getting to be Pip has been a dream,” she gushed of portraying the famous character. “Whether you’ve read the book or not, A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder is an experience all around. I think people are really going to like it.”</p><p>Jackson’s A Good Girl’s Good to Murder was published in 2019 and became a New York Times bestseller. Following the success of the first novel, Jackson, 31, followed it with Good Girl, Bad Blood in 2020, As Good As Dead in 2021 and a prequel for Pip, Kill Joy, also in 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Good-Girls-Guide-to-Murder-With-Emma-MyersiIs-Coming-to-Netflix.jpg><p>The bestselling author noted that she was “beyond excited” that her novel was being turned into a series.</p><p>“I hope viewers will love discovering (or rediscovering) all the secrets and lies of our small English town – Little Kilton,” she told Netflix’s Tudum on Monday. “Viewer’s can expect laugh-out-loud moments from all the teenage antics, but also all the pulse-pounding twists you’d find in the darkest of thrillers. Heartbreak, tears, gasps, swooning at all the PipRavi moments brought to life, watching behind a cushion, cursing my name … be prepared for it all when A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder hits your screens later this year.”</p><p>A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder isn’t the only mystery series coming to Netflix this year.
