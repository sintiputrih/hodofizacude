She shared several photos that gave a close-up view of her face and though she stated she wasn’t feeling well, the Grammy-winning singer looked beautiful.</p><p>Now that the world knows that Miley and Cody Simpson were kissing, fans are wondering who gave the sickness to whom and if Cody is feeling under the weather as well.</p><p>It’s likely that Miley Cyrus is currently contagious and both she and Cody would probably do well to get a checkup at the doctor since she is sick.</p><p>You may see several photos of Miley Cyrus sick in bed with tonsilitis below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3U9SuWnJwB/</p><p>Miley has been the subject of headline news since she split with her husband of less than a year, Liam Hemsworth. Miley was spotted galavanting around Italy with Kaitlynn Carter and the two were virtually inseparable for several months.</p><p>Now that relationship is over and it seems Miley has moved on with Cody Simpson. In fact, Cody seems to be so smitten with Miley, he wrote a message to her on his Prince Neptune Instagram account in the form of a sexual-themed poem.</p><p>Will their budding relationship survive a case of tonsilitis?</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Vq1XmnqBs/</p><p>The poem Cody wrote for Miley not only speaks of making love, but it was beautifully written and went viral.</p><p>Cody Simpson wrote the following under his Prince Neptune account.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3UifpWhhRF/</p><p>“the moon’s souvenir<br>the boulevardier<br>a ballerina on the promenade</p><p>we open our curtains<br>to the domesticated world<br>for a natural hour<br>spinning elvis records<br>and making love<br>in the soft jewelled morning”<br>– Prince Neptune<br>Miley recently discussed how the public feels she is moving to fast from one relationship to another, especially after splitting from husband Liam.</p><p>Some have even suggested that the rapid succession of these relationships is erratic and some think there may be something else going on. More than one comment has surfaced questioning if Miley may be bipolar or having some sort of mental health issue.</p><p>Miley has announced that she knows what she is doing and is an adult. Though she may be moving quickly from one relationship to the next, her body may be telling her that it’s time to slow down, especially now that she has tonsilitis.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think?
