When I (found out) I kept asking them, ‘are you sure?’ because I was truly in disbelief,” Spiranac said at the time. “To me being sexy is about confidence and feeling comfortable in your own skin. I’ve always tried to stay true to myself though out my unconventional path and now I’m so proud to be following so many amazing women who carried the title in years before me.

It's worth noting that she's the first sportswoman to take the top spot in Maxim's hot-100 list, which first appeared in 2000. Spiranac briefly opened up about her relationship status last month.</p><p>During a Q&A session on her 'Playing a Round' podcast in June, Spiranac expressed her desire to remarry following a "traumatic" divorce from athletic trainer Steven Tinoco. “As you guys know, I am divorced,” the golfer said at the time. “I wasn’t married for very long and I think that when I initially got divorced, I said I will never get married ever again.” While it's unclear when the pair parted ways, she revealed in March that she's "no longer married."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqJGetKZ50qmgq5melrBusc2snKaanJp6rq3XoqRmm5%2BrsrN5xaipZquVrbamv9NmrqilkaN6orjIr5w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sebastian-stans-dating-history-leighton-meester-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Sebastian Stan's Dating History: Leighton Meester and More</span></a>
