So, what exactly happened between Nicolette and Marcy Cherry? Let's dive in!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>'Desperate Housewives': Here's How The Cast Members Are Making Money Now</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-nicolette-amp-marc-cherry>What Happened Between Nicolette & Marc Cherry?</h2><p>Nicolette Sheridan joined the cast of Desperate Housewives back in 2004! While she wasn't necessarily part of the main cast, which was made up of Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman, Teri Hatcher, and Marcia Cross, Sheridan certainly brought enough flare to the role for her to stand out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicolette's character, Edie Britt, remains one of the most iconic characters of the show to date, however, <strong>she was given the boot in 2009 and for reasons, you wouldn't believe</strong>! Despite being a fan favorite, viewers said their goodbyes to Britt after she was electrocuted&nbsp;back in season 5.</p><p>While characters on TV shows being killed off is nothing new to the industry, it appears as if Nicolette wasn't written off because it was her time to go, but<strong> reportedly out of spite by show creator, Marc Cherry.</strong></p><p>During her time on the show, Nicolette revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was struck in the head by Cherry,</a> and after complaining about the altercation, Marc wrote her off the show, says Entertainment Weekly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Little Known Facts About Eva Longoria's Time On Desperate Housewives</a></span></p><p><strong>"I was the victim of assault and battery on the set of Desperate Housewives by the creator of the show, my boss,"</strong> Sheridan said. "I reported him and was retaliated against for doing so and fired."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Marc Cherry never openly spoke out about the allegations, his legal team did, saying, "Nicolette Sheridan was not a victim at the hands of Marc Cherry - a court has already ruled to that effect after hearing the testimony of multiple witnesses."</p><p>Sheridan went after Cherry in what would become an 8-year long lawsuit! Despite her efforts and support from many fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her case was thrown out in 2017,</a> however, <strong>Nicolette went ahead and appealed the decision.</strong></p><p>Despite things still being very messy, Nicolette went on to find success on the hit Netflix series, Dynasty, where she played none other than Alexis Carrington.</p><p>The star has also been <strong>urged by Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fans to join the show</strong>, as she and Lisa Rinna have quite a past. This would create quite a full-circle moment for Sheridan, considering Desperate Housewives played a key role in inspiring Bravo's hit series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Eva Longoria Amassed Her $80 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnqugmr%2BiwMRmn6ito5rEqsLErGSwoJGpeqmtz6mcp52UYq%2BmwNaenKdlnp6wsLjEraueZaOdsrO1w5qlZpmemXqurdGcZJyglae%2Funs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-akrawi-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Akrawi Net Worth</span></a>
