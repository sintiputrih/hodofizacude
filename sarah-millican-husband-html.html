I’d still be in the job I hated, watching telly in a damp flat. I had to go really low to come back up.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Since then, not only has comedy helped her find success, it has also led her to love.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Millican says she can make her marriage with husband Delaney work because both of them are funny. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Speaking about her thoughts on secrets to a happy marriage, the comedian said that you need to be with someone you find funny and who finds you funny.</p><p>She added it was easier to get through tough parts of relationships and life if you could laugh through it.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuRp66pecyio6Whk5a7brTUrJmappRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./claudia-pechstein.html><span>←</span><span>Claudia Pechstein - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
