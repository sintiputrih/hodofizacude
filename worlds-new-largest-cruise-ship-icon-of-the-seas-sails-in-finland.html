However, to say all was “ship shape” would be inaccurate.

At the prow an impressive 25-metre-tall glass structure - the ‘Aquadome’ - containing the tallest ‘waterfall at sea’. As possibly the only waterfall at sea, that didn’t stop them from reaching for the stars.</p><p>The ship is so large the builders refer to each section of the Icon as “neighbourhoods”, of which there are eight. This includes ‘Central Park’ - a landscaped, green space in the central cavity of the ship - <a href=#>furthering comparisons to a city at sea</a>. Throughout these districts are a choice of 40 different diners and restaurants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/Tm597N1sBiIrW6MAMTMSAUUBS4g=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/JHJ33CM5UBCQ5DRGJLMAJSMIAM.jfif"><p>She is around five times the size of the Titanic.

Royal Caribbean says these were the preliminary tests with a second set of sea trials scheduled that “will push Icon to its limits later this year”.</p><p>The Icon will be joined by a sister ship Utopia of the Seas, which is scheduled to go into service later next year. However, at a projected 236,860 Gross Tons for the second Oasis-class ship, the Icon still clinches the record as the world’s largest cruise ship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmraqRq7Kte9aoqaWco2K7psOMpZirn5WowW6v0a6grJ1dqLWqvIyimqimXaSzbsDHnmSsnZGoerStyKWqZqGeYrOqusuapZ1ndICSjqWkjH%2BNjnSLpY%2BZlm2Gb4hkepZ0nLBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-penn-played-a-little-known-role-in-shania-twains-career.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Penn Played A Little-Known Role In Shania Twain's Career</span></a>
