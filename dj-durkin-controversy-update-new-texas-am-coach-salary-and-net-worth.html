He was accused of intimidating and creating a fearful environment among his players. Verbal abuse, belittling, and humiliation was common.</p><p>Further, the eating habits endorsed were criticized by many players. Following the series of toxic events in Maryland along with the death of a player pointed fingers at Durkin leading to his suspension.</p><p>An article written by USAToday claims that the coach never deserved a second chance and rightly so. Twitter today has again brought up the 2018 controversy and discussions on the same.</p><p>His business partner, Chris Partridge’s death hoax is circulating on the web recently. Twitteratis are connecting it to DJ and his past controversy but the Chris Partridge who died is a different person.
