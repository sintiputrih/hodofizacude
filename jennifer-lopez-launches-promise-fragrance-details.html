She just crushed it in box-office hit, Hustlers and now, she has more exciting news up her sleeve! Late on Thursday, September 26, beauty editors flocked to a super-special pop-up event in New York City to meet with Jennifer Lopez ahead of the launch of her 25th fragrance: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Promise Eau de Parfum</a>.</p><p>The superstar arrived to the scene around 10 p.m., donning a plunging white ensemble from Michael Kors, paired with white pointed-toe high heels and flawless-looking hair and makeup. She held the new luxe-looking, light-pink fragrance in her hand, which resembles a chic gemstone that was born to live on your vanity.</p><p>As for the specifics about the scent that’s about to be the talk of the town, it’s the ultimate combination of fruity, floral and woody notes, making it a delightful scent to spritz on all fall long.</p><p>Lopez revealed that the inspiration for Promise comes from a surprising source. She said, “About a year or two ago, I was having dinner with Warren Buffett and he told me something that really resonated with me. He said, ‘A brand is a promise.’ It’s really the foundation that kind of keeps us going.”</p><p>She continued, “I just thought it was a perfect time in my life to name a fragrance ‘promise’ because every time that we create something new, it’s a promise to give something of quality — something that will make your life better or make you feel sexy and beautiful. That’s the idea [for this new perfume.] And that’s what I want to convey to everybody.”</p><p>To celebrate the new launch, you can attend the aforementioned pop-up shop in New York City, which is basically a &nbsp;goldmine for die-hard J. Lo fans. While you’re there, check out the new fragrance before purchasing it, all while getting an in-person look at J. Lo’s most iconic outfits of all time — including the Versace dress.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lopez <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared the news</a> about her new fragrance on Instagram, along with a promo for the pop-up, writing, “If you’re in NYC you have to go see it tomorrow before it’s gone!” But be warned: you’ll need to act fast. The store will only be open on Friday, September 27 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 34 Little West 12th Street in New York City.</p><p>Thankfully, Promise is already available! It’s an Ulta exclusive, so you can already add it to your virtual shopping cart — available in four sizes which range from $22 for the <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a> spray to $65 for the 3.4 ounce size. Promise Eau de Parfum will officially launch in stores on October 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvJnqWnoZaav264zqmcs2WclsKvr8eeqmaooqS6qr%2FEZp2rmZenrq%2BvxGabnqyRnrm0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./herve-villechaize-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Herve Villechaize Net Worth 2024</span></a>
