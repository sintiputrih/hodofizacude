Initially working at a gas station, he later opened his own small barbershop in 1952. His barbershop, named “Johnny’s,” quickly became popular and a frequent place for many local politicians, businessmen, and celebrities.</p><p>In 1981, Murray married Betty Thompson, and they had two sons, Michael and Steven.
