Everyone knows that orange crocs are the #1 cause of divorce in America. Either way it was a bad joke and [I] feel terrible if you or anyone though I was serious. Thanks for understanding sweatpants. Sorry orange crocs,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned</a> a photo.&nbsp;</p><p>Gosling also hopped on Twitter to defend the Lost River actress. “Obviously sweatpants thing was a joke. Wearing them now. That’s right, tweeting in sweatpants. Rats! Said too much! You win again Twitter,” Gosling, 34, <a href=# rel=noopener>responded</a> on March 19.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5rDonnMnqWdnaNitaLAxKxksJ2Rp7avs4yjnJqmo2KworjLrGStoJWiera6wqikn6eiqa6juMRmm56skZ65tHmRaWhuamNofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aine-finlayson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-199861-html.html><span>←</span><span>Aine Finlayson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
