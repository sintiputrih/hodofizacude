When Monster in Law came up, Fonda recalled sustaining an injury while filming the rom-com's pivotal slapping scene.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The scene in question see's Fonda's titular mother-in-law, Viola, show up to her son and Lopez's character Charlie's wedding wearing a white gown, after attempting to break the couple up throughout the movie. After Charlie slaps Viola in response to the latter's last-ditch effort to sabotage the event, Charlie tries to apologize, but Viola slaps her right back, delivering the iconic line: "You don't go and slap somebody and then apologize, get some backbone."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The thing that comes to mind right away is we have a slapping scene. I slap her, she slaps me," Fonda told Barrymore of the film. "Well, Jennifer—as per Jennifer—she had this enormous diamond ring. And so, when she slapped me one of the times, it cut open across my eye, my eyebrow."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After a pause, Fonda added, "She's never apologized."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lopez had previously spoken on the same incident in a 2019 video, where she admitted that she accidentally injured Fonda. In the clip, Lopez said she was "mortified" by the incident and later apologized.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We talked about how we were going to do this over and over again. I was so afraid to hit Jane Fonda in the face or hurt her in any way," the multi-hyphenate said. "I was so afraid of her and she was so brazen and like, 'Just hit me! Don’t worry about it, it's gonna be fine!'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that the scene took on a life of its own. "I just remember afterward Jane had a blood blister right at the top of her eye. My nail, like, went up into her eye. I was mortified. I was [like], 'Oh, I’m so sorry,' and she was like, 'It's fine, it's fine!'...She didn't care. She's such a gangster bitch. I just love her."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the possible miscommunication, there hasn't seemed to be any bad blood between the two stars over the years. Fonda previously supported Lopez when the superstar received her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Most of these stars are on this Hollywood Walk of Fame are for a person that has one talent," said Fonda said of Lopez <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/news/135344_Jennifer_Lopez_Cries_as_She_Receives_Star_on_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at the time" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">at the time</a>.
