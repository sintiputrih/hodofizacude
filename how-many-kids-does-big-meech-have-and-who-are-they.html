However, there is an alleged daughter named Manessa Mia Hussey.</strong></p><p>While there are rumors that the former drug lord has numerous children, only two have been brought to the fore. Big Meech and his brother Terry were in charge of a large drug organization known as the Black Mafia Family for many years before they were busted and sent to jail. Terry is out on parole but Big Meech is still serving time. Though his legacy is nothing to write home about, it has inspired a TV show produced by Curtis ’50 Cent’ Jackson who bought the rights to the Black Mafia Family story.</p><h2><strong>How Many Kids Does Big Meech have?</strong></h2><p>There are rumors he has more but only two children have been directly linked to Biig Meech. His son, Demetrius Flenory Jr. is the most popular while Manessa Mia Hussey seems to be his daughter too.</p><h3><strong>Demetrius Flenory Jr. (Lil Meech)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> April 22, 2000</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 23 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Latarra Eutsey</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> actor and rapper</li></ul><p>Lil Meech was born to Big Meech and his former partner, Latarra Eutsey, on April 22, 2000. An American by nationality, he was born in Miami, Florida, many years after his father’s drug business was established in 1985 in Southwest Detroit. The drug business came to an end in 2005 after which Big Meech was sent to jail and as of then, Lil Meech was just five years old.</p><p>This means that Big Meech and his son, Demetrius Flenory Jr. got separated at an early age and he was raised by his mother. It also means his father didn’t influence him much. Nevertheless, they kept communication alive between them.</p><h2><strong>Big Meech’s Son is an Actor</strong></h2><p>Creating an entertainment business was one of the ways Big Meech was able to disguise his drug dealings for so long and Lil Meech was born into this world. It is safe to say he got his forte for the showbiz industry from his father.</p><p>His career as a rapper was made official upon the release of his debut song in 2019. The song titled Bad Habits was self-released by Lil Meech and it features a brief recording of his father conversing from prison.</p><p>Lil Meech’s career as an actor is what brought him to the limelight, right after he portrayed his father in 50 Cent’s BMF series adaptation but before then, he never had any interest in acting. According to Lil Meech, American rapper 50 Cent is responsible for waking up the acting talent in him. 50 Cent had bought the rights to the Black Mafia Family story to make a movie and a TV series from it but after many casting calls, he failed to get the right actor to portray Big Meech.</p><p>For some reason, 50 Cent thought Lil Meech would be right for the role but there was just one problem, he didn’t have any acting experience or interest in the craft. Lil Meech was enrolled in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas at the time and he was studying business but somehow, 50 Cent convinced him to move to Los Angeles to take acting classes to prepare him for the role.</p><p>At first, Lil Meech thought it was crazy but he was able to pull it off and now he wants a career in acting in the long run. His performance in the Black Mafia Family TV series received positive reviews from critics and viewers. The show has been renewed for a second season while Lil Meech is making more exploits as an actor. He joined the cast of HBO’s Euphoria in August 2021. Aside from BMF and Euphoria, Lil Meech has done one project on the small screen as Syl in Taurus (2022).</p><h2><strong>Is Manessa Mia Hussey Big Meech’s Daughter?</strong></h2><p>Many didn’t know Big Meech had a daughter until 2019 when the former drug lord’s mother shared an Instagram post to commemorate Manessa’s birthday. From her post, it is easy to see that Big Meech’s daughter was born on July 2nd but nothing more is known. Details like her year of birth and the identity of her mother are not known to the public.</p><p>From her pictures, it is clear that Manessa is an adult who might be involved in a career but the finer details are yet to be revealed. So far, there is nothing on her educational background or the career path she has chosen to thread. She apparently prefers to keep a low profile and stay away from media attention.</p><h3><strong>Other Big Meech’s Alleged Children</strong></h3><p>The actual number of children Big Meech has became unclear when many people claimed he is their father. As a result, it has been rumored that he has many children.</p><p>Demetria Edwadior Jackson Flenory is behind one of the recent claims. She emerged in the public space to say that she is Big Meech’s daughter but this has not been confirmed. Other people who claimed to be Big Meech’s children include Queen Turdy and Neeka. In the absence of proper confirmation of their claims, it might be safe to say they are just seeking fame through the BMF name.</p><h2><strong>Relationship Between Big Meech and his Children</strong></h2><p>Big Meech is still in prison as of the time of writing this piece even though his brother and partner in crime, Terry, has been released and placed on house arrest. Being behind bars makes it hard to keep in touch with the rest of the world but it seems he has a good relationship with his son.</p><p>Notably, Lil Meech was just five years old when his father went to prison but they never lost touch. Lil Meech has been communicating with his father in prison and was in constant communication with him during the production stage of the first season of the BMF TV series. Big Meech was also featured in his son’s debut track as a recording artist where he portrayed the drug boss conversing in prison for half a minute.</p><p>On the other hand, the nature of the relationship between Big Meech and his daughter, Manessa, is yet to be confirmed. Since she keeps a low profile, it is hard to say how close she is to her father.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmoaenYrqiuthmoqKco2KxsLHSZpmin12isqavx2afmq6VYq6vsIywn6hlkaeybsDHnrBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./funny-pictures-online.html><span>←</span><span>40 Hilarious Pictures That'll Make You Die of Laughter If You Look Too Long</span></a>
