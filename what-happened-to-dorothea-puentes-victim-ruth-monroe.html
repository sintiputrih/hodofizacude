Per <a href=# rel=noopener>The Cinemaholic</a>, eventually, Dorothy Miller, Benjamin Fink, Leona Carpenter, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Bert Montoya</a> all went missing while living in Puente’s home. However, it would be Bert Montoya’s disappearance that would lead to the end of Puente’s house of horrors. Unlike the other boarders, Montoya had someone who was looking out for him: Judy Moise (per the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Post</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6y1osCMoZipqJWjsqV506hknaeipMGpscBmp66dnqmytHnVopqtoZ1iv7bAx2akqKaipLJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./284651-waitress-receives-4400-tip-co-worker-is-html.html><span>←</span><span>Waitress Receives $4,400 Tip to Be Shared with Co-worker and Is Later Fired by Restaurant Owner</span></a>
