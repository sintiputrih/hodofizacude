I mean, I really didn’t like him," Gakwa's brother, Christopher Gakwa, told <a href=# aria-label="News Nation (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">News Nation</a>. "But you know, what do you do?"</p><p>Gakwa and Hightman soon moved to Gillette, <a href=#>Wyoming</a> but she remained in contact with her family every day through text.</p><p>On February 24, 2022, she had a video call with her father in Nairobi, Kenya.</p><p>Her family had noticed that her texts, which used to be written in her native Swahili, suddenly turned into English only.</p><p>Tarisai Githu, Gakwa's cousin whom she refers to as her sister, said that was a noticeable switch for her family.</p><p>"Not communicating with her dad, to me, that was the biggest red flag, because I know the relationship that they have, they are super close," said Githu.</p><p>Gakwa's brothers ended up driving 800 miles to Gillette to find out what was happening with their sister.</p><p>Hightman told them that Gakwa packed her clothes into two plastic bags and said she was leaving Gillette.</p><p>The woman then reportedly jumped into a dark-colored SUV and drove away, according to her fiancé.</p><p>This launched a search for Gawka, spearheaded by volunteers on foot, horseback, and with cadaver dogs.</p><p>Social media was also used to get the word out.</p><p>Stacy Koester, the lead searcher, coordinated the coverage of hundreds of miles, which helped police issue a be-on-the-lookout-for for a 55-gallon metal drum that may have been abandoned or buried.</p><p>"When it was winter out, a lady sent me a message and said, hey, you know, now that the snow is here, there’s a weird barrel on my property," she said.</p><p>Police and <a href=#>FBI</a> agents searched Hightman's home with their own cadaver dogs - each of whom paid close attention to a spot in the garage along with a flower bed that was visible from the street.</p><p>According to Wyoming-based journalist, Jennifer Kocher, law enforcement is acting on seal warrants but the public is unsure what prompted the search of Hightman's home.</p><p>"What tip came in? Or what evidence encouraged the police to come do that thorough search? Because that was their second time at the house," she told News Nation.</p><p>Hightman appeared in court on his charges, shocking Gakwa's family by changing his plea to guilty.</p><p>Gawka's older brother, Kennedy Wainaina, and his partner, Lucinda Anewenah, were in the <a href=#>courtroom</a> at the time.</p><p>"It was tough. When I walked in, I saw him. I wanted to throw up, you know, just to see him see I was just disgusted," said Anewenah.</p><p>Hightman's bond was revoked by the judge, leaving him to await his sentence in jail.</p><p>"I think it just clicked for us. And we had a sense of relief. When we saw the bailiffs handcuff him, oh my God, he’s going to jail. He’s going to jail," Anewenah continued.</p><p>Anewenah and Wainaina made a 12-hour drive to the hearing and they only spent an hour in the courtroom but Wainaina said it was worth it to show that there "is somebody actually behind her."</p><p>"She has a family. There are people missing her, there’s people wondering about her," he said.</p><p>Gakwa's family is still hoping for an answer.</p><p>"Anything done in the dark will come to light. The hardest thing is waiting for that light to come through," said Githu.</p><p>Whatever the answers may be, the family hopes they can focus on the beautiful memories they have of Gakwa.</p><p>"You just hope that it’s going to be soon, but soon can be next year. Soon can be in two years, soon can be next month," said Githu.</p><p>"But my prayer is that by the end of this year, we know what happened to our sister."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/missing-woman-irene-gakwas-family-817273201.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/missing-woman-irene-gakwas-family-817272927.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdoZn51f5BrZqKqlaOybrPApK6aZZ2ewLS1zaBkn6GRo7Cmec2aq6GZnmK1qrPHraSapl2Wv7Ox0q2cnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./video-game-movies-like-super-mario-bros-movie.html><span>←</span><span>Like The Super Mario Bros.
