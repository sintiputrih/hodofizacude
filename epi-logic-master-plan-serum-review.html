I truly believe the less you touch and fuss with your skin, the better, so my <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/a42088232/best-skincare-routine-order/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skincare routine" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">skincare routine</a> is quite simple.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">However, a few months ago, while in the middle of my nightly skincare routine I had an “aha” moment, and for the first time, I thought to myself, “Wow, Shani! Your skin looks as tired as you feel.” My next thought was a question to myself that crept up naturally: “What product can I incorporate into my skincare routine that won’t freak my skin out or cause irritation?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">My immediate inclination: A collagen-based serum. Why collagen based? Unlike a simple hyaluronic acid serum that helps to plump up the skin (and reduce the appearance of wrinkles on the surface), consistent use of a collagen serum can help to rebuild and strengthen the skin’s connective tissues from within.

I knew she wouldn’t recommend a product she hadn’t used to the fullest extent, so I headed over to the boutique the same day, and snagged a bottle for $230.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">I performed my nighttime skincare routine as normal, this time swapping my <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/g39123352/vitamin-c-serums/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vitamin C serum " class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0"><u>vitamin C serum </u></a>for the Master Plan serum and after just one application, my skin - and heart- was forever changed and a true love affair ensued. Here are all of the things to note about the formula and why my love for it runs deep.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0"><strong>The Formulation</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The Master Plan is a serum that restores skin to its optimal health by boosting collagen stores. Cell Service is Dr. Jeanniton’s patented human-derived growth factor and peptide blend that promotes intrinsic skin repair, boosting collagen stores. In addition, the hyaluronic acid and snow mushroom plump maximize hydration by pulling moisture into the skin while repairing the skin barrier. Soothing botanical extracts such as sea kelp and beta-glucan sourced from shiitake mushrooms nourish and aid in relieving skin-related stress. I mean — the name speaks for itself and I’ve always appreciated the fact that I can receive multiple skin benefits while only applying a single product. A bonus perk: the consistency is medium weight, and caters to even the most sensitive/delicate skin that (if desired), can be used both AM and PM.</p><p><h2 class="css-j26n9l e8seki10">Master Plan Collagen Renew Growth Factor Serum</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$230 at Violet Grey for Master Plan Collagen Renew Growth Factor Serum" data-href=https://www.violetgrey.com/en-us/shopping/master-plan-collagen-renew-growth-factor-serum-18131534 data-product-url=https://www.violetgrey.com/en-us/shopping/master-plan-collagen-renew-growth-factor-serum-18131534 data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$230 at Violet Grey" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.violetgrey.com/en-us/shopping/master-plan-collagen-renew-growth-factor-serum-18131534 data-vars-ga-product-id=1641299f-fdc6-48f6-ab15-6ce02450e422 data-vars-ga-product-price=$230.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=baf046d9-defb-4349-95a8-f948e947a1f2 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=master-plan-collagen-renew-growth-factor-serum-18131534 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link eyaokey0 en6kra60 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Master Plan Collagen Renew Growth Factor Serum" title="Master Plan Collagen Renew Growth Factor Serum" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1677168677-epi-logics-collagen-serum-1677168660.jpg width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-j26n9l e8seki10">Master Plan Collagen Renew Growth Factor Serum</h2></p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0"><strong>An Honest Review</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">It’s a trailblazing product that should be on everyone’s skincare shelf.

My hormonal blemishes have a shorter life span and leave fewer PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) spots. My skin looks and feels more hydrated, healthy, and even more balanced. I’ve been using it for 5 months now and have only seen advancements in how my skin repairs, heals, and behaves on a day-to-day basis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prjLnmWcp51kr6at1K2waKWRoLK2vIysoqKmXZius7GOmmtsaGJpgnaDjp6nomWcpLSqr4ymmKyslad6sbjAp2SsnaKqum6%2BxK%2Bgnq9f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-many-horses-compete-in-the-preakness-stakes.html><span>←</span><span>How Many Horses Compete in the Preakness Stakes?</span></a>
