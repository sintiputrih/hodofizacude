They were responsible for coining a whole new Shore vocabulary — “GTL” and “pulling a robbery,” for example — but it wasn’t long before the drama got real.</p><p>In the first season alone, <a href=#><strong>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</strong></a> got punched, <strong><a href=#>Angelina Pivarnick</a></strong> left the house with her clothes in trash bags and <a href=#><strong>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola</strong></a> started dating and broke up. Combined with the various antics of <a href=#><strong>Paul “DJ Pauly D” DelVecchio</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Vinny Guadagnino</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jenni “JWoww” Farley</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Deena Cortese</strong></a>, the latter whom joined the cast in season 3, it’s no wonder that the Shore crew started calling each other the “spiral squad.”</p><p>The drama didn’t stop with the reboot, Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, which premiered in April 2018 without Giancola. In the three years since it debuted, Sorrentino went to prison for tax evasion, Ortiz-Magro was arrested twice, Guadagnino became a Chippendale’s stripper, Farley got divorced, Pivarnick got married, Cortese had a baby and Polizzi left the show.</p><p>Despite all that, the roommates are still super close, attending each other’s weddings, baby showers and, in the case of DelVecchio, DJ sets. “We are all so close,” Sorrentino’s wife, <a href=#><strong>Lauren Sorrentino</strong></a>, told Us in April 2021. “We actually practically speak every day about everything in a group chat. They’re friends that have turned into family.”</p><p>Now everyone except Guadagnino and Pivarnick are parents or parents-to-be, but there’s no sign that the drama is slowing down — it just might get a little more family-friendly. Farley’s kids, for example, are now old enough to at least know the show exists. “[Meilani’s] like, ‘Mommy, they said you’re on Jersey Shore and Aunt Nicole got arrested and you peed behind a bar!’” the New York native <a href=#>told Us in April 2021</a>. “I was like, ‘Oh, my God!’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Past embarrassing incidents aside, Lauren thinks there’s a possibility the Jersey Shore children <a href=#>could end up with their own series</a> one day. “I think eventually there might even be a show when these kids turn 18 because that’s how close we are,” she said. “We really do see each other at family events, and they always share advice about becoming parents. It’s really amazing to have close friends like that.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at the family’s most memorable scandals:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXtqizxKyrZqKVp8CmxYysn6iqlWLApK3NnZilq12ptbO71KCfZqyYmnq6scCrqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anita-hatta-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-586189-html.html><span>←</span><span>Anita Hatta Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
