While speaking on Premier Live TV, Mark Henry was asked to discuss his experience working for Vince McMahon.
“Working with Vince was hard. Because he’s a perfectionist, and nobody’s perfect,” Mark Henry said. “So he told you you was rotten a lot. But he would always say how you [could] get better. Every wrestler that ever worked for him will tell you the same thing."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Every wrestler that ever worked for him will tell you the same thing.</p><p>“If you did something good, and you came through the curtain, he would pull those glasses down on his nose and be like, ‘That was good shit.’ If you got one of those, bro, it was like getting a raise. Because you knew that you was gonna get more time. You knew you were gonna get more opportunity on TV when he loved what you did.”</p><h2 id=h-mark-henry-on-his-hall-of-pain-run>Mark Henry On His Hall Of Pain Run</h2><p>Mark Henry continued by looking back on his Hall of Pain run. He described how he would try to pop McMahon with the things he said. Henry noted that McMahon would often laugh at his lines.</p><p>“When I started the Hall of Pain stuff, every week I would say something to try to pop him. He was my inspiration for some of the things that I said,” Mark Henry said. “The ‘That’s what I do, I’m great. I’m supposed to do this,’ he loved that.</p><p>“But when I said I’ll split your head to the white meat, stuff that he never heard before, he would laugh his ass [off]. He’d go, ‘You’re gonna do what?’ [Laughs] He loved that shit, so I leaned into it. Every week, I tried to do something. ‘If I start charging for air, keep your bill paid.’”</p><p>Henry’s Sexual Chocolate character came up in the conversation, and he said, “Sexual Chocolate was fun, but the Hall of Pain paid the bills.”</p><p>In 2021, Henry left WWE and signed with AEW. He has been with the company ever since.</p><p>The full interview can be seen here:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsaXJxYmK6or7KZp%2BepqKueri70aSgp59drLa1tIyvoKeblWK6pLnAoaanZaeWwG60wKubZqCVqHqiec%2BeqZ%2Bdk6m2sLrIrKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jarilo-vi-treasure-chests-locations.html><span>←</span><span>Honkai Star Rail: Jarilo-VI Treasure Chests Locations</span></a>
