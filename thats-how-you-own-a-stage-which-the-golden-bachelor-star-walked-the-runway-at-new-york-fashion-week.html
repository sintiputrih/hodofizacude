For those who are unfamiliar with the beloved competition series, the inaugural season of The Golden Bachelor followed the same format as The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, following the life of Gerry Turner, a 72-year-old who lost his wife and high school sweetheart to illness after being married for 43 years."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
