But one of the most tantalizing moments arrived in the very last few seconds. In a ‘90s-esque commercial for the Commonwealth, we got our first glimpse inside the mysterious community, which is replete with busy people, happy kids, and a well-dressed man named <a href=# class=T3D>Lance Hornsby</a> (played by Eighth Grade’s Josh Hamilton<a href=# class=T3D>)</a>. “Welcome to the Commonwealth,” he says with a smile.</p><p>Though the new setting seems like a happy one, viewers are right to be wary — remember how nice <a href=# class=T3D>Terminus</a> sounded on the radio? Plus, Lance is at one point flanked by <a href=# class=T3D>Commonwealth soldiers</a>, and the cheery clip cuts to a scene of Eugene being beaten by one of them. Is the Commonwealth a force for good or bad? It’s hard to say at this point, but fortunately, The Walking Dead comics provide a clearer idea of who Lance is and how he functions in the greater Commonwealth hierarchy.</p><h2>Lance Hornsby Is A High-Ranking Member Of The Commonwealth</h2><p>In the comics, Lance has a few high-ranking roles within the Commonwealth. At first, he’s introduced as part of the not-so-welcoming committee that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>interrogates Princess</a> and crew upon their arrival. As Comic Book reports, Lance took a firm approach to the newcomers but seemed to be impressed by them, too. “You seem like strong-willed people,” he says. “Don’t prove my first impression to be false.”</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Skybound Entertainment</p></figure><p>Because the Commonwealth is so keen on preserving the past way of life, new residents typically take up their old social standing and profession. For Lance, that meant working in an administrative role as the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Commonwealth bookkeeper</a> and deputy governor, per Screen Rant.</p><h2>He Reports To Commonwealth Governor Pamela Milton</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Josh Stringer/AMC</p></figure><p>As CinemaBlend explains, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lance may not be a total bad guy</a>, but “his loyalty is not guided by a moral balance.” Rather, his greatest allegiance seems to be to his community and the woman who runs it all, Governor Pamela Milton. Unsurprisingly, our group’s arrival in the Commonwealth shakes things up in the comics — eventually, a whole revolution breaks forth — and Lance finds himself tasked with quelling the tension to preserve the community’s carefully crafted status quo.</p><p>Even though Lance isn’t the head of the Commonwealth, his proximity to Governor Milton (and discretion in deciding who gets to call the community “home”) positions him as a powerful new force worth watching out for in the weeks ahead. Of course, he could just as easily side with the survivors; it wouldn’t be the first time a leader’s righthand man rebelled against authority on The Walking Dead. Just think back to the Governor and Milton Mamet’s tense friendship turned sour in Season 3.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqWZnpiybrTOq6WsmqlixKK4yqKloGWUmq6lecKopKKbow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-sophia-bush-taylor-kinneys-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Is Sophia Bush Taylor Kinneys Wife?</span></a>
