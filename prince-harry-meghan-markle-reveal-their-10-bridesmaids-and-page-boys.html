Their parents are Mrs. Benita Litt and Mr. Darren Litt.</p><p>After much speculation, Markle has indeed chosen to include the children of her best friend and stylist Jessica Mulroney, who is married to Ben Mulroney, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Miss Ivy Mulroney, 4, will be a bridesmaid while twins Brian and John Mulroney, 7, will be page boys. Harry’s godson Jasper Dyer, 6, the son of Mrs. Amanda Dyer and Mr. Mark Dyer M.V.O., will complete the adorable pack.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As Us Weekly exclusively reported in January, Markle and Jessica went to her first dress fitting together.
