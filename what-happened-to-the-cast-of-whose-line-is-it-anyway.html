The show first aired back in 1998 and starred a number of familiar faces, including Wayne Brady, Colin Mochrie, Ryan Stiles, and Drew Carey, who went on to become <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the newest host of 'The Price Is Right'</a>, replacing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Barker</a> in 2006.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The hilarious show ran for a whopping 8 seasons, officially coming to an end in 2007. Despite fans being heartbroken over the show's end, the cast went on to great things, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drew Carey's</a>&nbsp;time on his hit game show and Wayne Brady on 'Let's Make A Deal'. Many fans began to wonder what cast members Mochrie and Stiles had been up to, however, much to everyone's surprise, they returned to our screens in 2013!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Drew Carey Spends His Current $165 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=whose-line-is-it-anyway-where-are-they-now>'Whose Line Is It Anyway?'

The series aired back in 1998 starring none other than Drew Carey as the show's host and moderator, with Wayde Brady,&nbsp;Colin Mochrie, and Ryan Stiles appearing as the show's talent! On 'Whose Line', the performers would act out and improvise a series of songs, characters, scenes, and skits according to the instructions and hints provided by Drew Carey and the audience, at times.</p><p>Whichever cast member felt they could come up with the best act, would step up and give it a go! In 2001,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the show was upgraded with its very own stage</a> and studio audience, allowing it to grow more and more and ultimately become one of the most successful comedy shows on air. Well, in 2007, the show came to an end; leaving many fans quite upset. Drew Carey ended up replacing Bob Barker that same year as the host of 'Price Is Right', while Wayde Brady went on to become the host of 'Don't Forget The Lyrics'. While many of the cast found success after its end, fans want to know what happened to Mochrie and Stiles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Look At Wayne Brady's Relationship With His Ex-Wife, Mandie Taketa</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Whose-Line-Is-It-Anyway-CW-Network.jpg><p>Both stars went on to appear in a number of television shows and movies, playing an array of roles in projects such as 'Astro Boy', 'Reno 911!', 'Young Sheldon', and 'American Housewife', to name a few. However, in 2013, things took a turn and the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> CW announced the return of the series!</a> This meant that Wayne, Colin, and Ryan would all be returning, however, Drew Carey would not. Due to his success on 'The Prices Is Right', Carey was replaced by actress, Aisha Tyler, as the show's host.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the show was only meant to come back for a summer run, it has since remained on-air due to its growing success with a brand new generation of fans. Although Wayne Brady simultaneously appears on 'Whose Line', and 'Let's Make A Deal', the comedian still brings it each and every episode, only making it clearer as to just how much we've missed this great and hilarious cast.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Happened Between Emily Bett Rickards And Aisha Tyler?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDHnmScmaOperCyjLCfqKuVYrmqusRmoKxlmal6orrYsJiyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./slash-is-with-cocoeven-while-o-html.html><span>←</span><span>Slash is With Coco.Even While on Leno</span></a>
