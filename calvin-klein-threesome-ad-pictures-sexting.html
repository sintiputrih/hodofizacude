The famed fashion brand&nbsp;released a new campaign&nbsp;where they incorporated aspects of&nbsp;dating in the digital age.&nbsp;Their ads were plastered with sexting conversations and nothing was off limits -- not even threesomes! Racy and sexy ads are a part of the&nbsp;Calvin Klein brand, just look at their previous fashion campaigns featuring&nbsp;Kendall Jenner, 19, and&nbsp;Justin Bieber, 21! But this time,&nbsp;the fashion label took their ads one step further by including sexual text message conversations inspired by real people and events. Did CK cross the line&nbsp;with their latest&nbsp;racy ad campaign?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/calvin-klein-threesome-ad-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-1><span id=more-1790921></span>The company doesn’t think so, they just took inspiration from the way the younger generation is communicating. Calvin Klein&nbsp;just decided to take it one step further by taking the sexting and Tinder messages and incorporating them with sexy&nbsp;and&nbsp;provocative images.&nbsp;“Our past campaigns have been more image-driven and this one was about starting a conversation through provocation,” <strong>Melisa Goldie</strong>, Calvin Klein Inc. chief marketing officer, told&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>WWD</a>.&nbsp;“We saw a behavior happening out there —&nbsp;and not just [with] the younger generation.” In this day and age, everything has gone mobile and digital.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>[jwplatform k0FTCa4M]</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Tinder is a prime example of the changes in the dating world. “It’s really dating via digital. It’s authentic and true to how this consumer communicates,” Melisa continued to explain.&nbsp;“We’re highlighting the truth about dating – the meet up, the hookup and the freedom that you have through the digital dating landscape and how instantaneous it is.” While this move is definitely&nbsp;provocative, it’s a big step away from their usual celebrity-driven ads. Justin’s shirtless #mycalvins ads&nbsp;and Kendall’s topless poses in CK undies&nbsp;are great examples of their more recent campaigns.</p><h3>Kendall Flashes Her&nbsp;Butt In A Thong For Underwear Campaign</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Calvin Klein’s sexting ads are pretty racy, but it’s nothing new. Take this #mycalvins campaign Kendall posed for early July 2015. The&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> reality star is in nothing but a bra and undies — there’s even a shot of her showing off her&nbsp;partially covered backside!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>What do you think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
