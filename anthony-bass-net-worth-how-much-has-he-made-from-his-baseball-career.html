While she waited for him to pick her up outside the Dallas airport, she was anxious.</p><p>When Anthony called to say that he had circled the airport a few times but hadn’t seen her, they realised that he was on a different terminal after a short while.</p><p>She looked down, avoided eye contact, handed him her luggage, and leapt into his Tahoe as soon as he got out of the vehicle to give her a hug.</p><p>Though she quickly forgot that she was shy, he had a peculiar way of making her feel comfortable. Sydney was instantly made to feel at ease and made to laugh.</p><h3>How did Anthony propose to Jessie James Decker?</h3><p>Anthony organised a hike for them at Camel Back Mountain in Arizona on February 10.</p><p>It was their last week together before being apart for a few weeks because Anthony was there for his spring training with the Nippon Ham Fighters and he was about to depart for Japan.</p><p>She kept asking Anthony along the trip how far they still had to go because she was becoming fatigued, and he continued saying there was a good site they should reach.</p><p>In that, he was correct. After stopping and taking in the breathtaking scenery with her, he got down on one knee, opened the tiny box, and proposed to her.</p><p>She jumped into his arms out of sheer excitement and missed her chance to even glance at the ring. He smiled and chuckled as he asked Sydney if she wanted the ring after she responded yes and began crying.</p><p>Sydney responded, “Yes,” and he put the ring on her finger before hugging, crying, and laughing together.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Anthony-proposing-to-Jessie-James-Decker-1.jpg alt="anthony bass salary,how much does anthony bass make,anthony bass career earnings" width=705 height=1057 sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She loves him even more now that she thinks back on it because it was such a touching and beautiful moment.
