When a <b>tire</b> ages, it loses the protective resin which keeps the rubber from oxidizing and <b>drying</b> out. As those oils evaporate, the <b>tire</b> becomes brittle, and starts developing breaks and begins to break apart.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-tire-rot-look-like></span>What does tire rot look like?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Even in minor cases of <b>tire dry rot</b>, you may notice breaks on the sidewall of your <b>tire</b>.

That’s because <b>tire</b> rubber contains antiozonant, a chemical additive that slows <b>tire breaking</b> by protecting it from harmful UV rays and ozone.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-tire-shine-prevent-dry-rot></span>Does Tire Shine prevent dry rot?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A quick coating, reapplied every 4-8 weeks, is a quick blast of <b>tire</b> UV protection.
