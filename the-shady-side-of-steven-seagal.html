He met his first wife, Miyako Fujitani, at LAX in 1974, and it wasn't love at first sight — well, for Fujitani anyway. "When I met Steve, he had long hair, and he was very tall and skinny," she told <a href=#>Shoubudojo</a>. "I hate that type — skinny with long hair. I was frightened: he looked like a Japanese ghost!" Still, the couple married and had two children. But the fairytale ended after Seagal returned to the US to further his career.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Spy Magazine</a>, before Seagal left Japan, he vowed to Fujitani, "I will never betray you." So, it must have come as a shock when he married his second wife, Adrienne La Russa, in May 1984 — especially as he wasn't divorced from Fujitani until 1987. As per <a href=#>US Weekly</a>, Seagal then cheated on La Russa with Kelly LeBrock, who he eventually married and had three kids with. They divorced in 1996 after she discovered Seagal had been having an affair with their nanny, Arissa Wolf.</p><p>Seagal and Wolf didn't marry, but they did have a child together, daughter Savannah (via Kiwkireport). Seagal waited until 2009 to brush off his groom's suit again. As per <a href=#>HollywoodMask</a>, Seagal met Erdenetuya "Elle" Batsukh in 2001 while she was working as his interpreter in Mongolia — she became his assistant in addition to the fourth (and, so far, last) Mrs. Seagal. The two wed and welcomed their son, Kunzang, in 2009.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2xlZoFze9OhnGarmJaxunnSopueZZ%2BberTAxK%2Bcp2Wjmq6orcto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-tanko.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Tanko</span></a>
