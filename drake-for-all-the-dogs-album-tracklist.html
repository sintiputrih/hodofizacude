"A flower blocking the way. So, the flower is on fire. The racing car was maybe helping the goat. And there was some stairs, like some jail stairs. And there was one person who was, like, on top. And he got killed by the stick, by the track."</p><p>Drake then has some follow-up questions for his son.</p><p>"Daddy's name is next to the goat. Does that mean daddy is the goat?"
