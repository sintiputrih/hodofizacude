On top of good looks, she also has a pretty stunning body too that compliments her overall looks. However attaining such a good physique was not natural; in fact, Gina had to go through some extensive weight loss process to attain it. She even likes to talk a lot about it in social media too while her fans could not be any more proud of her. She, of course, thanks to her followers for their support for the sweetheart that she is.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Been getting lotsa compliments abt my weight loss.

She is currently in a relationship with her boyfriend named Tim. Although Gina like many other TV personalities prefers to keep her personal life a secret, she still can’t help gush at least a little about her boyfriend on social media. Looking at her posts like the one below, we can’t help ponder if Tim could be her possible husband.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>My friend's little boy & my boyfriend havin' a little "guy time" this weekend was almost enough to make my uterus twitch.
