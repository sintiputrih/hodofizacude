Well, for Gypsy Rose Blanchard this nightmare was very much a horrible reality that she could not escape from upon waking up.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>Carbamazepine, better known for its commercial name Tegretol, is the suspected medicine that probably caused Gypsy’s teeth to crumble. It is an anticonvulsant used to help with symptoms of epilepsy, a disease Dee Dee alleged her daughter Gypsy had and for which she began needlessly “treating” her. It is also possible that poor nutrition and bad hygiene contributed to Gypsy’s teeth rotting.</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=89 data-injectable=false>Her front teeth were deemed unsavable by a dentist and removed when she was 18 years old.</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Today, Gypsy has a beautiful smile.

In July, the inmate married a man named Ryan Scott Anderson and more recently, she was released from prison.
