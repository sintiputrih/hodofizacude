Never mind the star-studded celeb box she sat in (featuring newly single dinner pal Sophie Turner and other new single Hugh Jackman), nor the fact that if there’s one person famous enough to get the Chiefs to change their name, it’s her: Rather, the <a href=#>most guilty of private-plane-using celebs</a> now has <a href=#>a whole new crop</a> of links, photos, and stories that come up when you google <a href=#>“Taylor Swift jet.”</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnasxe1n000d3b7hbv9lxv6o@published data-word-count=183>Okay, no one is saying Taylor Swift is <a href=#>maybe-dating football player Travis Kelce</a> with the sole purpose of one day watching a New York Jets game from the comfort of a private suite in order to permanently bury the emissions data about her private-jet usage and catapult pictures of her and the Deadpool universe to the top of Google results instead. But she, like the shrewdest of celebs and most humble of bloggers alike, is almost certainly not ignorant of a too-good-to-be-true coincidence of search-engine optimization. As <a href=#>fans</a> and haters (<a href=#>journalists</a>) continue to monitor her <a href=#>contribution to the ongoing climate crisis,</a> and the chances of someone of her star power cutting down on private flying remain just as likely as Harry Styles featuring on 1989 (Taylor’s Version) — nice in theory but won’t happen — why wouldn’t she play up an outing with more populist appeal and just as much SEO juice? Forget how Taylor Swift went from New York to Kansas City and back to New Jersey so fast (jets) — all that matters is whom she saw play on Sunday (Jets)!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnasxe34000e3b7h06yx377d@published data-word-count=83>Though we’re still a few weeks out from <a href=#>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</a>, fans are already theorizing that her from-the-vault track “Slut!” (exclamation point hers) <a href=#>will take back</a> “the narrative surrounding her ‘love life’ and all the vicious slut-shaming she got from the media and the public eye.” In other words, it too will have search-result implications. Googling “1989 taylor” will only ever result in, well, Taylor’s version, no whiff of Scooter Braun on the coveted first page of indexed results, just as she wants.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnasxe4i000f3b7huaf35y7c@published data-word-count=17>Swift isn’t the only celeb to weaponize SEO in their favor.
