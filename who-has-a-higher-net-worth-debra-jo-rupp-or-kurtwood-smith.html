Their stature — not just in the industry — but also as cast members from the parent series is reportedly recognized with the highest salaries.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Showbiz Galore</a> , the seasoned pair received a remuneration of $60,000 per episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That amount is double the next highest on the list, with lead star Callie Haverda on a reported $30,000 per episode.

She featured as the character Mae, previously portrayed by Madeleine Sherwood, Daphne Anderson and Joan Pape.</p><p>Rupp’s other most notable stage roles include To Kill a Mockingbird, The Cake, Becoming Dr. Ruth and Dr. Ruth, All the Way.

Her big screen credits include movies like She Wants Me, She's Out of My League, Jackson and Kickin' It Old Skool.

On the screen, he started out in the early ‘80s by featuring in movies like Roadie, Staying Alive and Flashpoint, as well as the TV shows Soap, Lou Grant and The Renegades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Smith’s breakout role came in the 1987 film RoboCop, where he played the character Clarence Boddicker.

Other major movie roles of Smith’s career include in Dead Poets Society, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Broken Arrow, and A Time to Kill.</p><p>On television, other than That ‘70s Show, Smith is best known for his portrayal of the characters Dick Clayton in Worst Week, Senator Blaine Mayer in 24 and Lt. James Gordon in <a href=#><strong>DC</strong></a>’s animated series Beware the Batman. By January 2023, Celebrity Net Worth estimated that the actor had accrued <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a net worth of $10 million</a>, exactly double that of his colleague and friend, Rupp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddna60ecBmn6KfmJq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptW6wxJupmmWapHqzwc%2BpZKiqXaDCs8DWqKadZaOitrW0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ronnie-devoe-net-worth-lifestyle-charity-career.html><span>←</span><span>Ronnie DeVoe Net Worth: Lifestyle, Charity &amp;amp; Career</span></a>
