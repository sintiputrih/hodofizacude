Having started as an Edinburgh Fringe performer, he set his sights on Hollywood and tried his hand at acting. Starring in multiple popular films including <i>Get Him to the Greek</i>, <i>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</i> and <i>Despicable Me</i>, the star ultimately decided acting wasn’t for him and embarked on another journey.</p><p>While he moved away from films, Brand made the most of his stardom during its peak and stayed in front of the camera, however this time it was for the small screen. Hosting multiple shows including <i>Celebrity Big Brother’s Big Mouth</i>, and his own namesake show, <i>Brand X with Russell Brand</i>, he soon returned to his roots as a comedy performer.</p><p>Until the allegations made by <i>The Sunday Times</i>, <i>The Times of London</i>, and <i>Channel 4′s Dispatches</i> were made public, the multi-talented star was earning huge profit from his stand-up career, and his own YouTube series, <i>The Trews: True News with Russell Brand </i>which he started in 2014, and uses to promote conspiracy theories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/l1IoemNz_ktMkDJhIPAO-EnPbdo=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/A2LC55EJHBEZXIPVCR43UPCMRU.JPG"><p>Brand also has Youtube channels <i>Football Is Nice</i>, subscribed to by approximately 20,000, <i>Awakening With Russell</i>, with 426,000 subscribers, and <i>Stay Free With Russell Brand</i>, holding 22,200 subscribers. YouTube has confirmed the star cannot use them for monetisation purposes at this point in time, <i>The Mirror</i> reports.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Other business ventures making Brand money include a self-produced podcast called <i>Stay Free with Russell Brand</i>, and allows fans to listen for a fee of £48 ($99). He also has a popular account on the right-wing video platform Rumble, where his channel has 1.4 million followers, however it’s not clear if - or how much, money he makes from the account.</p><p>Brand has other earning opportunities from his Instagram merchandise store and had a book deal with London publisher Pan Macmillan - however, that has since been terminated.</p><p>Taking into consideration these revenue streams, the wealth website Celebrity Net Worth has placed the star at having an estimated worth of £16 million ($33 million).</p><h2 class=article__heading>How much was Brand making on YouTube?</h2><p>With almost 6.6m subscribers on the video sharing platform, the star could be making close to £1m ($2.07 million) a year from his channel alone. The figure is based on five videos a week and does not include any affiliate deals and brand sponsorships - something that could make Brand even more income.</p><p>Speaking to the <i>Guardian</i>, Sara McCorquodale, chief executive of social media analysis agency CORQ said, “He is most likely making £2000 ($4144) to £4000 ($8288) per video.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/1JVuIDtRrMaDbZsTSb0si-Je1m8=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/3YI6FTSHANBCHGDZDWCANULSPU.jpg"><p>However, earlier this week the service announced monetisation of Brand’s account <a href=#>has been suspended</a> “following serious allegations against the creator”.</p><p>“This decision applies to all channels that may be owned or operated by Russell Brand,” the Google-owned video service said.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Brand’s assets</h2><p>As well as a large media following which earns the star huge money, he also has his own physical assets including multiple homes and cars.</p><p>The Mirror has reported he currently resides in a £3.3m ($6.8m) Victorian Gothic Oxfordshire mansion with his family which includes wife Laura Gallacher and their two - soon to be three - children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/VVsSvclRBQD3wBvnciZBLK370jc=/16x20/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/6BOUH3GKEBE3DDADZRQMYTJAZM.jpg"><p>Meanwhile, The Richest reported Brand has a £1.4m ($2.9m) home in Hollywood Hills West as well as a lavish car collection, which includes a Volvo XC90 worth over $100,000.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The <i>Evening Standard</i> has also reported the comedian owns a pub called The Crown, in Oxfordshire, however, it has not opened since he took ownership in 2020.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Katy Perry prenup</h2><p>During the couple’s <a href=#>short-lived marriage</a> that lasted for 14 months between October 2010 and December 2011 before they officially divorced in July 2012, <i>The Mirror</i> reported Perry made a whopping £35m ($74.5mn).</p><p>While they didn’t sign a prenup, Brand may have been entitled to some of his ex-wife’s impressive income - however, reports at the time revealed that he left without taking a single cent of her money.</p><p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> reported that Brand wasn’t interested in taking her money and was intent on making sure their separation was quiet and amicable.
