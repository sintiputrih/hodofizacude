He is a director, producer, and actor, best known for his role as Nathan Scott in the long-running TV series “One Tree Hill”. He’s also been a part of various films and television series. All his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is James Lafferty? As of mid-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $5 million, mostly earned through a successful career as an actor. He’s also made many guest appearances and television films, and has been nominated for awards several times. As he continues to work his wealth will likely increase.</p><h3>James Lafferty Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>James’ first experience at acting was when he was 10 years old, in a school play. Later he attended Hemet High School where he became a member of the school basketball team. After matriculating, he attended California State University but later stopped to pursue his acting career. He moved to North Carolina after being cast for “One Tree Hill”.</p><p>While Lafferty moved away from college to pursue acting in the hit series, his first role was voicing for the film “Annabelle’s Wish”. He was no stranger to television series either, as he had already made guest appearances in shows such as “Boston Public”, “Get Real” and “Once and Again”. He was also a part of “A Season on the Brink”, a television movie by ESPN, which focused on the basketball team of Indiana University during the 1985 to 1986 season. He was cast to be part of “One Tree Hill” in 2003, and the series would run for nine seasons; he portrayed one-half of estranged half-brothers in the show, and in the final season transitioned into a recurring role. During his time in the series, he had directing opportunities for a few episodes. This was an important source for his net worth.</p><p>In 2008, he became part of the film “S. Darko”, a sequel to “Donnie Darko” though it went straight-to-DVD. Three years later, he tried his hand at producing, a show entitled “Wild Life: A New Generation of Wild” in which he starred alongside Stuart Lafferty and <a href=#>Stephen Colletti</a>. The series filmed a pilot but due to difficulties the series failed to gain any traction. One of his most recent works was directing an episode of “The Royals”.</p><p>James has been nominated four times for Teen Choice Awards, all of which are for his performance in “One Tree Hill”. Nomination categories include Breakout TV Star, Scene Stealer, TV Chemistry, and Parental Unit.</p><p>For his personal life, there is no information on any romantic associations for James. He is well known for playing basketball, and took part in the 2008 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game alongside <a href=#>Terrell Owens</a>, <a href=#>Ne-Yo</a> and <a href=#>Seth Gilliam</a>; he supports the Wilmington Sea Dawgs. Lafferty is also a Tae Kwon Do black belt. Other hobbies he has include various sports such as skiing, snowboarding, football, and horseback riding. He also organised a charity basketball event between 2003-09, but then cancelled it because of threats and harassment to his family. He currently resides in Williamsburg, Brookyln.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=14.465699208443><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>James Lafferty</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 25, 1985</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Hemet, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.88&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>American actor, director, producer</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Hemet High School, California State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Angie Lafferty , Jeff Lafferty</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Stuart Lafferty</td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/ThisIsLafferty</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.29508196721311><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/thisisjameslafferty/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0480798</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>Teen Choice Awards (2004, 2005, 2010)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>"Oculus" (2013), "Waffle Street" (2015), "S.
