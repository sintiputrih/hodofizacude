Whether it’s his rap songs or the smooth R&B ballads he’s become known for, every release seems to bring both hits and top-charting songs to the party.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>A successful career in music comes with an equally important question: who is supporting Drake in his musical endeavors?
