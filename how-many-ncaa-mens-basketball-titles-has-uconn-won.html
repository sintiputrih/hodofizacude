<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>How many NCAA mens basketball titles has UConn won?</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fanarch.com/cdn/shop/articles/juc.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span>The University of Connecticut (UConn) has a storied history in men's college basketball, with numerous conference championships, Final Four appearances, and national championships to its name. In total, UConn has won four NCAA men's basketball titles, making it one of the most successful programs in college basketball history.</span></p><p><span>The first national championship for UConn came in 1999, when the Huskies defeated Duke in the championship game. Led by future NBA players Richard Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin, UConn finished the season with a record of 34-2 and secured the program's first-ever national title.</span></p><p><span>UConn's second national championship came just six years later, in 2004. This time, the Huskies defeated Georgia Tech in the championship game, led by the trio of Emeka Okafor, Ben Gordon, and Charlie Villanueva. UConn finished the season with a record of 33-6 and secured its second national title in just six years.</span></p><p><span>After a few years without a national title, UConn returned to the top of college basketball in 2011. Led by future NBA All-Star Kemba Walker, the Huskies won an incredible 11 straight games in the postseason, including five wins in five days to win the Big East tournament. In the national championship game, UConn defeated Butler to win its third national title in program history.</span></p><p><span>UConn's most recent national championship came in 2014, when the Huskies once again defeated Kentucky in the championship game. Led by guards Shabazz Napier and Ryan Boatright, UConn finished the season with a record of 32-8 and secured the program's fourth national title.</span></p><p><span>In addition to its four national championships, UConn has also made numerous Final Four appearances, including in 2009, 2011, and 2014. The program has won 10 regular-season conference championships and 7 conference tournament championships.</span></p><p><span>UConn's success in men's college basketball has been due in large part to the coaching of Jim Calhoun and Kevin Ollie. Calhoun, who coached at UConn from 1986-2012, led the program to three of its four national championships and is considered one of the greatest coaches in college basketball history. Ollie, who played for Calhoun at UConn and later coached the program from 2012-2018, led the Huskies to their fourth national championship in 2014.</span></p><p><span>Overall, UConn's success in men's college basketball has been nothing short of remarkable. With four national championships, numerous Final Four appearances, and a history of producing NBA talent, UConn is one of the premier programs in college basketball and will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBlnZa7unnNnJiaZZ2au7R5wZqqpJ2kl66tuIytoK2klah6qa3SZqycp56jeri7zQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fernando-cruz.html><span>←</span><span>Fernando Cruz</span></a>
