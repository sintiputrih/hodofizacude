And though the places and means through which millions of people celebrate the annual autumnal festival have changed over time, the festival’s tenets — celebrating the season, giving thanks for the harvest and praying for a brighter future — have remained the same.</p><p>In practice, these values translate to burning incense, performing dragon and lion dances (particularly popular in China and Vietnam), lighting lanterns, and making mooncakes — lotus paste-filled pastries which can be as small as a plum or as large as a pool and signify familial unity.</p><p>Beyond the exorbitant light and food displays, the most notable events pertaining to the Mid-Autumn Festival center on matchmaking. Indeed, in certain parts of China, participants hold dances for single men to meet single women. In Vietnam, these courtship rituals have included singing competitions, wherein single men and women would perform songs until the best-rated man and woman remained. The two would be paired together as a “match,” and the cycle would thus repeat.</p><p>At present, the millennia-old festival takes place throughout China, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and neighboring countries — with its age-old traditions reminding us that larger-than-life celebrations of the season don’t necessarily have to involve retail.</p><p>For more fascinating celebrations from around the world, check out <a href=#>Turkey's camel wrestling festival</a> and <a href=#>La Tomatina, a decades-old Spanish event where thousands of people congregate in a small town to hurl over 300,000 pounds of tomatoes at one another</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyutcNmmK6spaK7brLErKuirpGh</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./willie-geist-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Willie Geist Net Worth</span></a>
