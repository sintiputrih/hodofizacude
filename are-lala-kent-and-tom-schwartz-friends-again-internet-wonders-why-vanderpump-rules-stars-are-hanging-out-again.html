Lala was disgusted by the fact that Schwartz made out with Raquel on the show. Lala slammed Schwartz throughout the show for being favorable towards Raquel.</p><p>However, this was not the case. Schwartz did not miss an opportunity to call Lala the "corniest human" in the whole place. The two got into a heated argument over a Coachella-themed proposal to Raquel. But it seems the feud between Lala and Schwartz has found peace. Recently, the 'Vanderpump Rules' star posted a picture with James Kennedy, and guess who got the picture credit, it was Schwartz. This actually suggests that Lala and Schwartz are friends again.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'You go, girl!' Internet roots for 'Vanderpump Rules' star Raquel Leviss' comeback after cheating scandal</a></p><h2 class=split>Are Lala Kent and Tom Schwartz friends again?</h2><p>Yes, that seems to be the case according to Lala's latest post. The reality star uploaded a picture with James where they are both smoking a cigar together. She wrote in the caption, "The last time I smoked a cigar I was 3 sheets to the wind, inhaled it, and ü§Æ everywhere." Towards the end of the caption, Lala gave credit, "Photo x @twschwa." The fact that Schwartz is tagged in the picture means that Lala is hanging out with him. So the feud that broke out between them over Raquel has finally died down.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Internet just cannot stand Dave Portnoy as he denies dating 'trash bag' Raquel Leviss in shady post</a></p><h2 class=split>'Can‚Äôt wait to see how that happened'</h2><p>Internet was shocked seeing Lala tag Schwartz in her photo. A user wrote, "Okay so the door cracked open for Schwartz. I support that." Another excited fan claimed, "So you and Tom are good?! Can‚Äôt wait to see how that happened." Another user explained the reason why Tom and Lala have been hanging out together now, "didn't Tom and Tom kinda "break up" so it can make sense why these three would be hanging out." "Yeah but her reasons for not liking Schwartz were tired to her ex. Maybe Schwartz cut him off and apologized to her," speculated a user. A user asked Lala, "Why is she friends with Tom!?" To this, a user replied, "seriously...I don't understand the CONSTANT hate. Like gtfo it." Another speculated, "probably for contract/fulming reasons. If Ariana refuses to be around him, and they want him on the show.. someone has to be friends with him for it to be more organic."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'Vanderpump Rules' star Tom Sandoval labeled a 'narcissist' as he goes shirtless to promote his podcast 'Everybody Loves Tom'</a></p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
