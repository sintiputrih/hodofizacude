They aren't usually caused by one specific thing. Triggers build up until the person becomes so overwhelmed that they can't take in any more information.<h2>Is Asperger's hereditary?</h2>The cause of Asperger syndrome, like most ASDs, is not fully understood, but there is a strong genetic basis, which means it does tend to run in families. Multiple environmental factors are also thought to play an important role in the development of all ASDs.<h2>Do people with autism have to pay taxes?</h2>Is Autism Considered a Disability on Taxes?

As a result, they cannot imagine their way into the minds of others to anticipate their responses.<h2>Do I have to tell my employer I have Aspergers?</h2>Disclosure and accessing support<p>Your employer needs to know that you have an autistic spectrum condition in order to make any 'reasonable adjustments', if you need them.
