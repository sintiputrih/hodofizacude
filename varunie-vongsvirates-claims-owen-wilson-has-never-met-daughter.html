“He has never met her, unfortunately,” Vongsvirates, 37, told theDaily Mail on Monday, October 11, just days after Lyla turned 3 years old.
Us Weekly confirmed in October 2018 that Vongsvirates welcomed a baby girl named Lyla with the Wedding Crashers actor, now 52.
Lyla is the third child, and only girl, for Wilson, who shares 10-year-old son Robert Ford with Jade Duell and 7-year-old son Finn with Caroline Lindqvist."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She told the outlet in 2019 that the Starsky & Hutch actor “helps financially but it’s never been about that.”</p><p>She further explained that “Lyla needs a father,” calling it “ironic” that Wilson “keeps getting these father roles, he’s playing a father in his new movie, and he’s never met his own daughter.”</p><p>Despite having an allegedly strained relationship with Vongsvirates, whom he dated for five years before their split, and his daughter, Wilson appears to have <a href=#>a good coparenting situation with his two sons</a>.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Royal Tenenbaums actor gave fans a rare glimpse at his life as a father of two boys when speaking with Esquire in August.</p><p>The Loki star shared <a href=#>a story about cutting his youngest son’s fingernails</a>, explaining that when Finn told him not to “go below the line,” Wilson told him to “relax.” The comedian noted that his son later said thank you for helping him but whispered, “For nothing!”</p><p>Wilson recalled being very similar as a child, reflecting on how things have changed over the years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s funny how we get cast in these roles, because it seems like just yesterday, I was the one muttering ‘for nothing,’ and now I’m the person in this role,” he said. “Once you’re an adult, you think childhood was so innocent and beautiful, but you forget. … That’s a big part of being a kid: being broken. It’s like Cool Hand Luke — I’m breaking him. And then he says, ‘For nothing.’ That was me.”</p><p>Us reached out to Wilson’s rep for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGavmaKqu6qxjK%2Bmp5%2Bjq7azrdOeqmabnJa2rr%2BMqK6epl2stq2%2FzqdkoZmjYrumwsSrZKadpGKxosHGoaueql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raul-esparza-previews-barbas-big-return-on-law-order-special-victims-unit.html><span>←</span><span>Raul Esparza previews Barbas big return on Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</span></a>
