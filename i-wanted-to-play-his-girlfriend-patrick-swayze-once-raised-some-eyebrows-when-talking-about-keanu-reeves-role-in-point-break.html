Is he kidding?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>“You’re trying to affect me with sight and sound and you know, blind me like ‘give me some kind of experience’ but there’s no story, no heart.” What’s fun about an interview like this is I don’t speak Japanese so we don’t really hear questions in order we just hear answers. Fun!</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>When asked about the theme of the movie. Reeves goes deep again. I really can’t tell if he’s serious because he delivers every line the same. “I guess it’s the restructuring of a man and a belief system, and a discovery of yourself.”</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>He’s making it sound like this movie is the visual equivalent of Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road.” Wait. Is it? Point Break came out in July of 1991. Kurt Cobain was still alive. The Internet wasn’t a thing yet. Barack Obama was still in his 20s! Things were different.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>Swayze chimes in. “It makes a statement about our society in the United States, of giving up on yourself and becoming part of a system rather than staying an individual.”</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>Of course, the key philosophical lamentation of the movie is that surfing is a religious, transcendent activity.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>“Surfing is a very humbling experience,” Swayze said. “It really is,” Reeves responded. “You learn a lot about yourself in the water.”</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Had human civilization peaked in 1991? Sounds like it! Swayze, you’re a legend. Just listen to this: “Once I saw skydiving as ballet or gymnastics it all came pretty easy to me.”</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>They’re making Point Break sound like it’s Citizen Kane. The PR person for 20th Century Fox was probably high fiving themselves all the way to lunch.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>The interviewer asked about casting. “I would..” Swayze said, and Reeves quickly said “Don’t.” Hm.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>“I wanted to play his girlfriend,” Swayze said. “I knew that was coming,” Reeves laughed. 1991! What a time to be alive.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false>Point Break is available to watch or rent on various streaming services. It’s great. The 2015 remake is hot trash though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2bsPAp6uenF2pvG68y5qwZqCZqHqotdGlnauhlaOxbrzAramim5tiwLit2LOcZqeemLJuvsCiqp6cXai8rrGMnrCemqKkxLR51qGcp2Wklrmstc2gZJqan6rBbrfEmqWuZaKasrex0mapqKSVYravec%2BooKesXZe%2Fpq3KaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diesel-rojas-net-worth-139893.html><span>←</span><span>Diesel Rojas Net Worth</span></a>
