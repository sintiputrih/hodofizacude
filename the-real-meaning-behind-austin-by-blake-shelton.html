Singing from the boy's perspective, Shelton realizes his mistake in the song and wants to repair the relationship he had with his girlfriend <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>after they broke up</a>. This sentiment is communicated in the last two lines of the chorus, "And P.S. if this is Austin / I still love you."</p><p dir=ltr>Shelton identified with the song's message, telling <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>The Country Daily</a>&nbsp;in 2001, "I've had girlfriends I've gotten back together with after we'd broken up, and it never worked out, but 'Austin' relates to all of those situations, whether it works out or not. It's really about second chances."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Manna and Kent wrote the song after the former heard about a fellow songwriter breaking up with his girlfriend. The girlfriend moved to Austin, Texas, where it also inspired the song name. Per <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>CMT</a>, Shelton initially thought the song was too emotional until his producer Bobby Braddock told him that lots of women liked it and convinced his A&R to send the single to radio stations, which changed Shelton's life forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBlbIR1e9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZpmlqMGquoybsGaanJa4pnnSoZylrJ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miranda-brooke.html><span>←</span><span>Miranda Brooke</span></a>
