<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>ATP Vienna Open: Alexander Zverev vs Andrey Rublev; Preview, Head-to-Head, andPrediction</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It is the quarter finals of the Vienna Open and only the best 8 names in the tournament remain. With a chance to inch one step closer to glory, the players will battle it out to showcase their dominance and make a name for themselves here in Vienna. One among them will be <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Andrey Rublev</a>. Coming into the tournament as a hot favorite, he would be looking to grab his ticket into the semi-finals of the tournament.</p><p>However, standing his way will be the dominant force of <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Alexander Zverev</a>, who has his own fair share when it comes to the title triumph. However, only one among them will be able to make it through. That being said, who among the two is a clear favorite going into the match? Let’s find out!</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Andrey Rublev vs Alexander Zverev: preview</h2><p>Coming into the tournament, Andrey Rublev looks to pose serious title threats to his competitors. After managing a <strong>51-24</strong> record for the season, he managed to lay his hands on his maiden <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>1000 Masters title in Monaco</a>. Not only this, he has managed to make his way into the finals of the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Shanghai Masters</a>, <strong>Halle Open</strong>, <strong>Dubai Finals</strong>, and<strong> Banja Luka.</strong></p><p>Coming into the Vienna Open, he faced <strong>Alexei Popyrin</strong> in the first round. In the second round, he faced the Italian <strong>Matteo Arnaldi</strong>. After pulling in some efforts in the first set, he managed to secure the victory by defeating his opponent with a scoreline of <strong>7-5, 6-3</strong>.</p><p>On the other hand, his opponent Alexander Zverev defeated <strong>Cameron Norrie</strong> in straight sets in the second round of the tournament. With a comfortable scoreline of <strong>6-2, 6-4</strong>, the German made his way into the quarter-finals while showcasing everyone why he is still one of the top contenders to win the title here in Vienna.</p><p>With the win, he also maintained his impressive <strong>51-24</strong> record for the season. Having won the <strong>Chengdu Open</strong> and having made his way into the semi-finals of the tournament, his form saw a slight dip after bowing out early in the first round at the Shanghai Masters and the Tokyo Open.</p><p>But, in the Vienna Open, he has returned to winning ways and will be targeting title glory. The match between the two big names will be a pure joy to watch.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Rublev vs Zverev: Head-to-head</h2><p>When it comes to the head-to-head encounters, the German player has an impressive lead after winning 5 of the 7 encounters between the two. Their first ever encounter came back in 2016 when the two faced each other at the ATP Masters 1000 Monte Carlo. A determined Zverev defeated Rublev <strong>6-1, 6-3.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-02-25T155219Z_366626747_UP1EI2P1834RV_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-DUBAI.jpg><p>However, here’s the catch. In the two encounters that the two had, Rublev emerged victorious in them. Their last meeting came in the quarter-finals of the Bastad Open in Sweden. Rublev defeated Zverev <strong>6-2, 6-3</strong> in the quarter-finals.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Prediction: Andrey Rublev to take home victory in a tight battle</h2><p>One thing is for sure, these two will produce one of the best battles in the tournament. With a place in the semi-finals on the line, these two players will do whatever it takes to win the match and progress further. However, at the moment, Rublev poses a strong hand over his German rival. Having won back-to-back encounters in the head-to-head lead, he will be pretty confident to bag another win this time around.</p><p>However, after a series of disappointments, Zverev has returned to winning ways and will be confident of making it through to the semi-finals. However, the win won’t come easy for either of the two as they will give in their everything. But, it is time that will reveal who among the two makes it further.</p><p>What are your views on this?
