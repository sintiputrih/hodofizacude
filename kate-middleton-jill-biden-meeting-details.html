Upon arrival, the couple visited a class to hear how young boys and girls have been supported through a bespoke Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) teaching system, which uses child-led learning to help develop the pupils as confident and independent learners.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The visit was also an opportunity for the two women—who were meeting for the first time—to get to know each other a little better. For Dr. Biden, she was keen to hear more about the royal family’s newest addition, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, who was born to Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry on June 4.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I wish her all the very best,” Kate, who wore a pink Alexander McQueen shift dress, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36697663/kate-middleton-makes-first-comments-on-baby-lili/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said of her new niece" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">said of her new niece</a>. “I can’t wait to meet her. We haven’t met yet. I hope that will be soon.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr. Biden continues to teach while fulfilling her role as First Lady, so picking a school that reflected both women’s interests was important, especially as she and President Joe Biden are committed to increasing opportunities for children and youth to grow, learn, and gain skills to succeed. Connor Downs Academy is part of a network of schools in Cornwall that focuses on helping students reach their potential, while recognizing the importance of nurturing positive relationships and supporting mental health and well-being of both children and staff.</p><img alt="jill biden, kate middleton" title=BRITAIN-US-G7-SUMMIT-ROYALS width=5982 height=3980 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/britains-catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-and-us-first-lady-news-photo-1623420562.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Dr. Biden and Duchess Kate visit a class at Connor Downs Academy in Hayle, Cornwall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During their roundtable session, the pair heard from eight representatives (four in the room and four video-calling from the U.S.) working in the early-years sector.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The importance of providing adequate support for parents and children alike during early childhood, and the positive impact that this can have across society, is something which Her Royal Highness and The First Lady have both gained an understanding of through their respective work,” a Kensington Palace spokesperson shared in a media release with BAZAAR.com.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There were also a few lighter moments for the pair during the engagement. Duchess Kate and Dr. Biden joined the school’s “animal cadets” to help feed rabbits outside, with the First Lady pictured carrying a large bowl of carrots.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their engagement comes ahead of Friday evening’s G-7 leaders reception, which will take place banquet style at the Eden Project worldwide attraction. The two women will join their husbands, Prince William and President Biden, alongside the queen, Prince Charles, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Afterward, Kate will join Her Majesty and Camilla at an event of The Big Lunch community volunteering initiative, launched ahead of next year’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36606590/queen-elizabeth-platinum-jubilee-plans-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="platinum jubilee for the queen" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">platinum jubilee for the queen</a>.</p><img alt="kate middleton, jill biden" title=BRITAIN-US-G7-SUMMIT-ROYALS width=4668 height=3112 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/britains-catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-talks-with-us-first-news-photo-1623420798.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Duchess Kate walks with Dr. Biden, who carries carrots to feed pet rabbits during their visit to Connor Downs Academy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On Thursday, June 3, Dr. Biden was asked about her and the president’s plans to have tea with the queen at Windsor Castle on Sunday. “Joe and I are both looking forward to meeting the queen,” she said. “That’s an exciting part of the visit for us. We’ve looked forward to this for weeks and now it’s finally here.
