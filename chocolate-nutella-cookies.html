I really wanted the Nutella to be the star of the show and for the flavor to come through once the cookie is baked. Thankfully, the cookies came out of the oven and you better believe my little daughter was first in line to be my taste tester. These <strong>Chocolate Nutella Cookies passed with flying colors.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Chocolate-Nutella-Cookies-4.jpg alt="Chocolate Nutella Cookies.

Since it has a good amount of oil in it, it adds that creaminess that I was seeking. I replaced some of the butter with Nutella and the rest is history.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Chocolate-Nutella-Cookies-6.jpg alt="Chocolate Nutella Cookies.

I found that balance of sweet salted butter and creamy Nutella to bring balance to these cookies. I dare you not to take a few tastes of Nutella. It’s not easy (speaking from experience).</li><li><strong>Use both brown sugar and sugar in this recipe</strong>. Brown sugar gives these cookies the depth of flavor and chewy texture. The sugar gives it those slightly crunchy edges.</li><li><strong>Use unsweetened cocoa powder for that extra boost of chocolate flavor</strong>. The more chocolate, the better! Am I right?</li><li><strong>Use chocolate chunks or chips</strong>. I chop up a real, high-quality chocolate bar because it melts so beautifully. I use the Trader Joe’s Pound Plus Chocolate Bar. It is imported from Belgium and the price is right for such high-quality chocolate.</li><li><strong>CHILL the dough</strong>.&nbsp; It gives the dough time to solidify and helps to keep the cookies from spreading so much once the dough hits the hot oven. The Nutella can encourage spreading so by chilling the dough, it slows down the process. Chill for at least 30 minutes – 1 hour but overnight is ideal.</li><li><strong>Bake until the edges start to crisp and the center is still chewy</strong>.&nbsp; You will see indentions start to form on the edges of the cookie.</li><li><strong>Sprinkle with a light dusting of sea salt if you like the sweet and salty combo</strong>. It’s a great balance to these sweet cookies.</li><li>If you want to elevate these Chocolate Nutella Cookies, <strong>add chopped Milky Way candy bars</strong> and you have Chocolate Nutella Caramel Cookies. Oh my word. They are ridiculous.</li><li>If using caramel bars, use a <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00008T960 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><span><strong>silicone Silpat baking sheet</strong></span></a> or <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00C37QN2C data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong><span>parchment paper</span></strong></a> to keep the caramel from sticking to the pan.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Chocolate-Nutella-Caramel-Cookies-12.jpg alt="Chocolate Nutella Caramel Cookies.

I tested these Chocolate Nutella Cookies using two different kinds of Milky Way Bars. I used the traditional Chocolate Caramel Milky Way Bars and cut them into bite-size pieces. However, I opened up my baking cupboard and found a stash of Fun-Size Dark Chocolate Milky Way Candy Bars with Marshmallow and Caramel and I knew that I had to throw those babies in there as well.&nbsp; Basically, I am here to confirm that ALL are viable options. My husband couldn’t pick a favorite. <strong>When I asked him which cookie he liked best out of the 3, he said, “all of them.”</strong> He’s so helpful. 🙂</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Chocolate-Nutella-Cookies-15.jpg alt="Chocolate Nutella Caramel Cookies.

He has had to endure so many treatments to fight the disease and it’s been so heartbreaking for their family. I am helping to raise funds in his honor and so many other children, who are continuing the battle.</p><p>This is the second year for our Valentine’s event! We want to make a difference in the fight against pediatric cancer!</p><p>Did you know that cancer is the #1 cause of death of children by disease in the U.S.? There are 40,000 U.S. children actively battling cancer right now. With less than 4% of the National Cancer Institute’s budget going to all childhood cancer combined, I knew it was important for me to get involved.</p><p>Help us make a difference by donating to <strong><span><a href=# rel=nofollow>Cookies for Kids’ Cancer</a>!</span></strong> Our goal is to raise at least $3000. Because these three companies: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dixie Crystals</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mediavine</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>OXO</a> have each pledged to match our donations raised through this campaign up to $3000!!!</p><p>Thanks to many of you, we have reached our goal. You can still donate and help us make an even bigger difference!</p><p><strong><span><a href=# rel=nofollow>Donate here.</a></span></strong></p><p><strong>Here are some awesome food bloggers recipes to support Cookies for Kids’ Cancer:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Yellow Heart-Shaped Rainbow Funfetti Cookies</a> from Julie of The Little Kitchen<br><a href=#>Peanut Butter Cookie Cake</a> from Julie of Julie Blanner<br><a href=#>Cherry Coconut Macaroons</a> from Miranda of Cookie Dough and Oven Mitt<br><a href=#>Brownie Cookies</a> from Mel of Mel’s Kitchen Cafe<br><a href=#>No-Bake Chocolate Candy Cookies</a> from Debi of Life Currents<br><a href=#>Double Dark Chocolate Chery Black Forest Cookies</a> from Jamie of Southern Revivals<br><a href=#>White Chocolate Valentine Madeleine Cookies</a> from Marlynn of Urban Bliss Life<br><a href=#>Pillowy Soft Sugar Cookies</a> from Stephie of Stephie Cooks<br><a href=#>Steak with Peppercorn Sauce</a> from Sonja of Ginger & Toasted Sesame<br><a href=#>Creamy Beet Risotto</a> from Rachel of Copper & Verdigris<br><a href=#>Valentine’s Day Chocolate Sugar Cookies</a> from Denise of Chez Us<br><a href=#>Red Velvet Donuts</a> from Gwynn of Swirls of Flavor<br><a href=#>S’mores Brown Butter Panbanging Cookies</a> from Marybeth of babysavers<br><a href=#>Gluten-Free Chocolate Kiss Cookies</a> from Audrey of Mama Knows Gluten Free<br><a href=#>Gluten-Free Red Velvet Crinkle Cookies</a> from Brianna of Flippin’ Delicious<br><a href=#>Rose Meringue Cookies</a> from Kirsten of Comfortably Domestic<br><a href=#>Raspberry Chipotle Chicken Curry</a> from Shashi of Savory Spin<br><a href=#>Double Chocolate Meringue Cookies</a> from Dee of Meatloaf and Melodrama<br><a href=#>White Chocolate Raspberry Smoothie</a> from Sarah of Sarah Cooks the Books<br><a href=#>Cream Wafer Cookies</a> from Kelly of Live Laugh Rowe<br><a href=#>White Chocolate and Raspberry Cookies</a> from Wanda of My Sweet Zepol<br><a href=#>Raspberry Fudge Cookies</a> from Jessica of A Kitchen Addiction<br><a href=#>Raspberry Cookies</a> from Courtney of Know Your Produce<br><a href=#>Syltkakor Raspberry Jam Cookies</a> from Megan of Stetted<br><a href=#>No-Bake Chocolate Tart</a> from Rachel of Rachel Cooks<br><a href=#>Heart-Shaped Chocolate Chip Cookies</a> from Angela of About a Mom<br><a href=#>Mexican Hot Chocolate Cookies</a> from Lisa of TasteCookSip<br><a href=#>Chai Latte Shortbread Hearts</a> from Sue of It’s Okay to Eat the Cupcake<br><a href=#>Soft and Sweet Sugar Cookie Bars</a> from Carlee of Cooking With Carlee<br><a href=#>Strawberry and Cream Cookies</a> from Ashley of A Cup of Charming<br><a href=#>Cherry Cream Cheese Cookies</a> from Lisa of Blogghetti<br><a href=#>Galete Waffle Cookies</a> from Shaina of Food for My Family<br><a href=#>Almond Shortbread Cookies</a> from Denise of addicted 2 recipes<br><a href=#>Easy Strawberry Fudge</a> from Chrysa of Thrifty Jinxy<br><a href=#>Valentine’s Day Mug Hug Cookies</a> from Aimee of Southern From Scratch<br><a href=#>Doughnut Sandwich Cookies</a> from Bree of Baked Bree<br><a href=#>Chocolate Nutella Cookies</a> from Melissa of Modern Honey<br><a href=#>Easy Crinkle Cookies</a> from Amy of The Nifty Foodie<br><a href=#>Chocolate Sugar Cookies</a> from Becca of The Salted Cookie<br><a href=#>Love Cake</a> from Sara of Confectionary Tales<br><a href=#>Meringue Cookies</a> from Sara of My Imperfect Kitchen</p><p><strong>Pin on PINTEREST:</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Chocolate-Nutella-Cookies-Recipe.jpg alt="Chocolate Nutella Cookies.
