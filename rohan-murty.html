Sharing his childhood experience, he said,</li></ul><p>We had a clunky old machine at home that my father used to work on sometimes. I was a bored eight-year-old whose only non-school activity was playing tennis. I didn’t read, have friends or any hobbies. One day, I turned on the computer and started poking about. My father got upset and yelled at me saying I should do something more creative. My mother put me in an evening class where they taught basic programming thrice a week. The people in my class were all working adults. Nothing made sense to me, a fourth-grader, but I stuck on. After six months, we had to work on a project and I started building a checkout-cum-inventory programme for a neighbourhood grocery store. Suddenly, everything I learned clicked; it was very exciting. Those were the pre-internet days, and I would go to the library looking for books with problems that I could write code for.”</p><ul><li>In 2016, he rejected a petition which was filed to remove Sheldon Pollock from the position of the Chief editor of the Murty Classical Library.</li></ul><ul><li>His PhD thesis is considered as path-breaking which was based on the use of white space (spectrum).</li></ul><ul><li>He is a dog lover and owns a dog, Gopi. <img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rohan-Murty-with-His-Dog-Gopi.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-35419 class=wp-caption-text>Rohan Murty with His Dog Gopi</p></li></ul><ul><li>His hobbies include reading books, dancing, and travelling.
