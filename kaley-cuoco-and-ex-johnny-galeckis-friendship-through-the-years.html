When the series began, they sparked an offscreen romance but <a href=#>kept their relationship out of the spotlight</a> before calling it quits.</p><p>“We dated really early on for almost two years. When we did the pilot, I was crushing so hard on Galecki, but he had a girlfriend,” Cuoco recalled during a November 2020 episode of <a href=#><strong>Dax Shepard</strong></a>‘s “Armchair Expert” podcast. “We got together and <a href=#>just fell mad for each other</a> for two years, but then we broke up. Luckily, Johnny and I came out of it so brilliantly and we’re closer today than we ever were.”</p><p>Each of the actors moved on in the wake of their romance, with the <a href=#>8 Simple Rules</a> alum marrying <a href=#><strong>Ryan Sweeting</strong></a> in 2013. Before she <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in October 2015, Cuoco said she felt “lucky” that her then-husband was such a fan of Galecki.</p><p>“Johnny is actually one of my best friends. It’s a situation that ended well. I understand sometimes it doesn’t. It could have gone horrible,” she said on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a> in September 2015. “He’s one of my dearest friends and Ryan loves him. Johnny loves [Ryan]. I got lucky.”</p><p>Following her split from Sweeting, the Charmed alum and Galecki <a href=#>sparked speculation of a reunion</a> more than once. Though Big Bang Theory fans would have loved to see the longtime costars rekindle their romance, Cuoco eventually <a href=#>tied the knot with <strong>Karl Cook</strong></a> in June 2018, with Galecki there to witness the magical moment.</p><p>“Deepest congrats to the newlyweds. Love you both so much @normancook & @mrtankcook So moved by tonight. ❤️,” the actor gushed via Instagram at the time, posing in between the married couple.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Galecki, for his part, <a href=#>welcomed son Avery with <strong>Alaina Meyer</strong></a> in November 2019.
