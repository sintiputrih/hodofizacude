Our turkey clocks in entire turkeys activate when the breast temperature reaches 170 degrees Fahrenheit.
Do pop-up turkey timers really function in this manner? We’d suggest just two pop-up timers out of the many available. If you must use a turkey timer, there are two pop-up models that are reliable: the Kikkerland turkey timer and the Norpro reusable pop-up turkey poultry timer (both available on Amazon). The reason these pop-up timers are superior is that they are programmed to activate between 160 and 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</description></item><item><title>Richard Rogers: Who Were His Victims?
