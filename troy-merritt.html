He golfed for Spring Lake Park (Minnesota) in high school and Winona State University (Minnesota) in college.</p><p>Later, he transferred to Boise State University. For Boise State, he was named to the first-team All-WAC. His parents were also educators. He is <strong>38 years old</strong>.</p><h2><span id=Troy_Merritt_8211_Net_Worth_2024>Troy Merritt – Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>While it’s difficult to put a precise figure on Merritt’s net worth because of his unrecorded purse payouts (the majority of them), sources have come up with a figure that they feel is close.</p><p>His first-place win in the 2009 Mexico Open earned him $117,500, while his third-place finish in the 2015 Heritage Classic netted him roughly $400,000. Despite finishing 125th on the PGA Tour’s money list in 2010, he earned far more than expected: $786k versus $680k.</p><p>He has competed in 248 PGA Tour tournaments and has ranked in the top 129 of them 129 times. According to CBS, his profits from those events were a little over $10 million.</p><p>His golf revenue is expected to exceed $700,000 in 2021. In 2015, he won the most money of his career, $2 million plus a few thousand dollars.</p><p>That is all that has ever been said regarding the worth of his purses. It’s still a little more difficult to estimate Troy Merritt’s actual <strong>net worth</strong>. Nonetheless, he is said to be the owner of wealth worth more than $5 million (approximately).</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Merritt is married to <strong>Courtney Achter</strong> and has two kids, Dodge and Scout, with her. Achter attended Broncos State University in Boise, Idaho, as a gymnast. On March 13, 2010, the pair married at the Casa Ybel Resort on Sanibel Island.</p><p>In an interview with the PGA Tour in October 2014, Achter said that her husband’s ambition from the start had been to be a professional golfer, which he had expressed to her on their first date. On Table Rock, a hiking route in Boise, Idaho, Merritt proposed to Achter.</p><p>“I turned around and there he was, and I was like, oh my god, you’re going to enjoy this, but it was wonderful,” Courtney recalled, recalling Troy’s proposal to her. The pair is currently based in Boise, Idaho.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Troy Merritt began his professional career in 2008. Merritt won his first Nationwide Tour event, the Mexico Open, on September 6, 2009, with a 20-foot birdie putt on the first hole of a playoff, defeating Australia’s Adam Bland.</p><p>Moreover, he became only the third golfer to win a medal at the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament by leading after every round on December 7, 2009.</p><p>He won by one stroke against veteran Jeff Maggert with a score of 22-under-par despite a double-bogey on the last (108th) hole of the six-round competition. Merritt finished 125th on the PGA Tour in 2010, earning the final position needed to keep his card.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-189623 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Troy-Merritt-career-Thelines.jpg alt="Troy Merritt" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-189623 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Troy Merritt captured during his game Source: The lines</p><p>Troy Merritt tied the course record at the Heritage on Hilton Head Island on April 17, 2015, with a 10-under-par 61, tying David Frost’s tournament record from 1994.</p><p>Merritt’s 61 came after Jordan Spieth, the 2015 Masters champion, shot 62 after a 74 in the first round.&nbsp;Merritt finished third in the tournament, behind Jim Furyk and Kevin Kisner, earning a total of $401,200.</p><p>Merritt won the 2015 Quicken Loans National for the first time on the PGA Tour.
