Here are ten names which were only chosen once in any year between 1944 and 1949 in South Australia, making them unique names for their time and place. Still rare, some feel surprisingly contemporary, while one or two have perhaps had their day.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Aston</strong></a></p><p>English surname of multiple origins. It can be from a common place name meaning “east settlement”, although occasionally it seems to be a corruption or variant of <a href=#><strong>Ashton</strong></a>, meaning “settlement near the ash trees.” It can also mean “at the stone,” to indicate someone who lived near a prominent stone. Finally, it can be a contraction of a personal name such as <strong>Aethelstan</strong>, meaning “noble stone,” and there are examples of men with <a href=#><strong>Aston</strong></a> as a first name in the Middle Ages from this derivation. Sir <a href=#>Aston</a> Cockayne, 1st <a href=#>Baronet</a>, was a 17th century writer who was on the Royalist side during the English Civil War, and a close friend of the future <a href=#>Charles</a> II. The name might remind you of <a href=#>Aston</a> <a href=#>Martin</a> luxury cars – familiar in the 1940s as. I see the name <a href=#>Aston</a> name sometimes in birth notices, perhaps inspired by <a href=#>Aston</a> Merrygold from English boy band JLS.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Bramwell</strong></a>English surname from an unknown place name meaning “stream surrounded by broom” – broom is a hardy European shrub with yellow flowers. The name has a strong connection with the Salvation <a href=#>Army</a>, because <a href=#>Bramwell</a> <a href=#>Booth</a> was its second <a href=#>General</a>, who served during World War I, the eldest son of its founder, <a href=#>William</a> <a href=#>Booth</a>. The Salvation <a href=#>Army</a> has a strong history in South Australia, with the first official corps formed in <a href=#>Adelaide</a> in 1880. <a href=#><strong>Booth</strong></a> was also used as a baby name during the 1940s, with the Salvation <a href=#>Army</a>’s support of the troops being greatly appreciated. <a href=#><strong>Bramwell</strong></a> is an attractive, little-used surname that has the appealing nickname <a href=#><strong>Bram</strong></a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Cosmo</strong></a>Form of the Greek name <strong>Kosmas</strong>, meaning “order,” and thus the opposite of “chaos.” The Greeks also used the word to mean “the world,” because they believed the world was perfectly in order. We use the word cosmos to mean “the universe, all of creation.” According to tradition, <a href=#>Saint</a> <a href=#>Cosmas</a> was a skilled doctor; along with his twin brother <a href=#>Damian</a>, he performed many miraculous cures before his martyrdom. The name <a href=#><strong>Cosmo</strong></a> was introduced to <a href=#>Britain</a> by the Scottish peer <a href=#>Alexander</a> <a href=#>Gordon</a>, 2nd <a href=#>Duke</a> of <a href=#>Gordon</a>, when he named his son <a href=#>Cosmo</a> in 1720, in honour of his father’s close friend <a href=#>Cosimo</a> di Medici. The name has always had a rather exotic and aristocratic image, and Scottish associations. There were several famous Cosmos that could have inspired the name in the 1940s, including popular British playwright <a href=#>Cosmo</a> <a href=#>Hamilton</a>.&nbsp;Cosmos is also a type of daisy, whose name comes from the same Greek origin, so with some imagination, the name <a href=#>Cosmo</a> could honour someone named <a href=#><strong>Daisy</strong></a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Denzil</strong></a>Variant of <a href=#><strong>Denzel</strong></a>, a Cornish surname. The name was traditional in the aristocratic Holles family, with one of the earliest and most famous of their number to bear the name <a href=#>Denzil</a> Holles, 1st <a href=#>Baron</a> Holles, a 17th century statesman who is best known for being part of a group who attempted to arrest <a href=#>King</a> <a href=#>Charles</a> I, sparking the Civil War, but also took a leading role in bringing about the Restoration. The <a href=#>Denzel</a> spelling came first, as <a href=#>Denzil</a> Holles’ grandfather was <a href=#>Denzel</a> Holles. These Denzils and Denzels were named in honour of their ancestor <a href=#>John</a> <a href=#>Denzel</a>, who had large estates in Cornwall in the 16th century and was Attorney-<a href=#>General</a> to <a href=#>Elizabeth</a> of <a href=#>York</a>, queen of <a href=#>Henry</a> VII. <a href=#>John</a> <a href=#>Denzel</a> took his surname from the <a href=#><strong>Denzell</strong></a> manor house in St Mawgan, Cornwall, and the meaning of its name is not known for sure, although perhaps from the Celtic for “hill fortress in open view.”<a href=#><strong>Denzil</strong></a> still seems contemporary because of actor <a href=#>Denzel</a> <a href=#>Washington</a>, and is very usable.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Everard</strong></a>Derived from the ancient Germanic name <a href=#><strong>Eberhard</strong></a>, often translated as “brave as a wild boar. The name was introduced by the Normans to <a href=#>Britain</a>, where there was already an Old English form of the name, <strong>Eoforheard</strong>. A famous namesake is Sir <a href=#>Everard</a> <a href=#>Digby</a>, who was executed for his part in the failed Gunpowder Plot, and another was <a href=#>Everard</a> Calthrop, a railway engineer who helped develop the modern parachute. Although in use since the Middle Ages, modern usage has probably been influenced by the surname, as the Everards are an aristocratic family who have been created baronets in both <a href=#>Ireland</a> and <a href=#>England</a>. <a href=#>Everard</a> <a href=#>Park</a> is a suburb of <a href=#>Adelaide</a>, named after the prominent pioneer Sir <a href=#>Charles</a> <a href=#>Everard</a>, said to have the best orchard in the colony, giving this a strong South Australian feel. <a href=#><strong>Everard</strong></a> is an interesting twist on classic&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Evan</strong></a>, and the trend for girls’ names starting with Ev- may also be a help.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Garfield</strong></a>English surname referring to someone living near a triangular field; the word gar means spear in Old English, and a gar field is one that is shaped like the point of a spearhead. The surname is well known in the United States, where the 20th president was <a href=#>James</a> A. <a href=#>Garfield</a>. A namesake from the 1940s was Hollywood &nbsp;actor <a href=#>John</a> <a href=#>Garfield</a>, while one with <a href=#>Garfield</a> as his first name is <a href=#>Garfield</a> “<a href=#><strong>Gar</strong></a>” <a href=#>Wood</a>, an American inventor, showman, and record-breaking motorboat racer – the first to travel over 100 miles an hour on water. &nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Garfield</strong></a> would be a charming and unusual vintage name, except for one thing – the obese cartoon cat!</p><p><a href=#><strong>Linus</strong></a>In Greek mythology, <a href=#><strong>Linus</strong></a> was a Thracian prince who was so musically talented that he was said to have been the son of <a href=#>Apollo</a>, god of music, and <a href=#>Calliope</a>, the muse of epic poetry. According to legend, <a href=#>Linus</a> invented melody and rhythm, and taught music to his brothers <a href=#>Orpheus</a> and <a href=#>Heracles</a>. Unfortunately, <a href=#>Heracles</a> didn’t appreciate the music lessons, and killed <a href=#>Linus</a> with his own lyre after he tried to give <a href=#>Heracles</a> some constructive criticism. Although the meaning of the name is not certain, there was a type of dirge in classical Greece called a linos, and it’s possible that the mythological character was a personification of this song of mourning. The name has a <a href=#>Christian</a> association because <a href=#>Linus</a> is said to have been a <a href=#>Bishop</a> of <a href=#>Rome</a> in the early church, and is listed as the second pope. The name <a href=#>Linus</a> is especially popular in Scandinavia, although many people will connect it to <a href=#>Linus</a> Pauling, the American scientist who won both the Nobel Chemistry Prize and the Nobel <a href=#>Peace</a> Prize, and whose work was already known by the 1940s. The name might also remind you of security blanket-hugging philosopher <a href=#>Linus</a> from the Peanuts comics. A sweet, smart name with a mythological musical connection.</p><p><strong>Neon</strong>Greek name meaning “new.” &nbsp;It wasn’t an unusual name in ancient Greece, and there are several prominent men named Neon from history. However, in modern times the name is strongly associated with neon lighting – bright electrified glass tubes often used for signs. They are named after neon gas, which is used to give off a bright orange light, but other gases provide different colours. Neon lighting was invented in 1910, and was in its heyday between 1920 and 1940, the bright colours suddenly bringing dark streets to life. It’s probably not a coincidence that the name Neon peaked in the 1940s and ’50s, usually given to boys. Neon feel both space age and vintage, and has been used as a comic book hero name, for both a male and female character. As neon is often used in an artistic context today, you might think of this as an arty name, and it’s otherwise bright and energetic.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Revel</strong></a>A revel is a festive celebration, while to revel is to make merry. The word comes from Old <a href=#>French</a>, and is directly related to the Latin rebello, from which our word (and name) <a href=#><strong>Rebel</strong></a> is derived. This is probably because we think of celebrations as tending to be rather unruly or disorderly, and sometimes they can even get out of hand! This fun-loving word has been used as a personal name since the Middle Ages in both <a href=#>England</a> and <a href=#>France</a>, and was also given as a nickname to people who were known for partying particularly hard. It is from this that the surname derives, and it is especially associated with Yorkshire. A famous Australian namesake is Western Australian Indigenous artist <a href=#>Revel</a> <a href=#>Cooper</a>, whose career began in the 1940s. <a href=#><strong>Revel</strong></a> is a boisterous medieval boys’ name that still sounds contemporary.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Rollo</strong></a><br><a href=#>Rollo</a> was a powerful 9th century Viking leader who was the founder and first ruler of the area of <a href=#>France</a> now known as Normandy. He was the great-great-great grandfather of <a href=#>William</a> the Conqueror, and through <a href=#>William</a>, is the ancestor of the present day British royal family, as well as all current European monarchs. His name is a Latinised form of the Old Norse name <strong>Hrólfr</strong>, which in modern times is known as <a href=#><strong>Rolf</strong></a>. It’s a shortened form of <strong>Hrodulf</strong>, now known as&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Rudolf</strong></a>, meaning “famous wolf”. <a href=#>Rollo</a> is also a Scottish surname, the Clan <a href=#>Rollo</a> being descended from the Normans, and in particular the nephew of <a href=#>William</a> the Conqueror, <a href=#>Erik</a> <a href=#>Rollo</a>. Because the Lords <a href=#>Rollo</a> is a title in the Scottish peerage, the name gains further aristocratic credentials. <a href=#>Rollo</a> fitted in well with 1940s name trends, when <a href=#>Rolf</a> and <a href=#><strong>Roland</strong></a> were fashionable. Like <a href=#>Cosmo</a>, it fits in with current trends for boys names ending in -o, and is a fun yet blue-blooded choice.</p><p>An expanded version of this blog appears on <a href=#>Anna</a>‘s Australian-oriented site, <a href=#>Waltzing More Than Matilda.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkaKyo7HRq7Bnm5%2BifKO4zqBmq5mimnqju9isZKeZnZrAbrvFZquhnV1mhnV80g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marco-ilso-family-wife-children-parents-siblings.html><span>←</span><span>Marco Ils family, wife, children, parents, siblings</span></a>
