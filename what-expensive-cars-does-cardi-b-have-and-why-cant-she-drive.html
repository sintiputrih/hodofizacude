<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>What expensive cars does Cardi B have and why cant she drive?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-characters=455 data-injectable=true data-video=true>With over 100 million followers on Instagram, enormous talent establishing the position as a trailblazer and immense popularity among fans, as well as across every media and social media channel, living and leading an ultra-luxurious life won’t come as a surprise. Yes, we are talking about none other than Belcalis Marleniz Almanzar, popularly known as <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardi B</a></strong>, a rapper, producer, and reality TV star who has become a phenomenon in the music industry.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Born in 1992 in New York City, Cardi B first became famous on Instagram and Vine. She later went on to star in the VH1 reality show Love & Hip Hop: New York before immersing in a full-time music career. As talented as she is as a rapper and a musician, which is clearly not an unknown fact, she has also managed to showcase her talent in social media handling, which has earned her millions of followers.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>She has around 10 million followers on TikTok and more than 30 million listeners on Spotify. Despite her noteworthy achievements, one habit of hers that has particularly captured the attention of media and people alike is her astronomical car collection. The Bodak Yellow rapper certainly hasn’t shied away from revealing her love for buying expensive luxury cars.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>In the world of Hollywood, this is definitely not a revelation, but what separates Cardi B from her celebrity cohorts in this area is that she doesn’t have a driver’s license. So, let’s throw some light on this luxurious habit.</p><h2 id=h-cardi-b-s-expensive-car-collection data-injectable=false><strong>Cardi B’s expensive car collection</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cardi-B-with-her-car.jpg><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=836 data-injectable=true>It doesn’t matter whether you love or hate Cardi B, but in case you share a love for luxurious cars, then a secret desire to get a glimpse of her garage is totally understandable. The rapper reportedly has a garage full of expensive and exotic cars. In October 2018, Cardi B posted a picture of one of the world’s fastest supercars, the Lamborghini Urus, which has a power output of approximately <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">478KkW/650 HP and 8 gear automatic transmission</a>. At the price of around<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> $240,000</a>, the vehicle serves as one of her coolest collections.</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Amongst her other car collections are relatively affordable selections like the Chevrolet Suburban, as well as the super chic Mercedes G Wagen. Her other collections include Lamborghini Aventador, which was bought after Cardi B and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Offset</a>’s daughter Kulture was born. Other vehicles in her collection include a Rolls Royce Wraith, a bright orange <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bentley Bentayga (whose purchase marked the success of Bodak Yellow)</a>, a Mercedes Maybach S-Class, and a McLaren 720S Spider.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>However, the pop star provided a solid reason for her car collection habit and that is, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she doesn’t want to be a poser</a> and paint a more authentic picture of her lifestyle choices. She stated that, unlike other social media celebrities who pose next to mansions and private jets as well as buy fake followers on social media platforms to give an impression of being rich, she wants to tell the world that her wealth is authentic.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Despite the exotic habit, the pop star claimed that she cannot drive legally, as she doesn’t have the license to do so. She revealed this on The Late Late Show with James Corden while on a drive in the British comedian’s car of choice, which was a Range Rover. She also went on to admit that in addition to not having the license, she also does not possess the required skills for driving.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=false>Whether she has a license or not, the rapper continues to achieve new heights in her profession. She continues to produce great music and undoubtedly has more success coming her way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZpyxqJWjwKrCxGaamqqjYrGwsdJmmpqqlJ56o3nHmq2eZZGjsW7Dx7JknJmeqXq0tMRmm6uhppp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saravanan-arul.html><span>←</span><span>Saravanan Arul- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</span></a>
