He had nails all over her head, just like the original, but her makeup was on point! Her leather outfit was also much sexier than Pinheads is in the movie, where she wore a very revealing corset and a thong, in addition to the chains. In the caption, the “Hot Girl Summer,” rapper showed just how excited she is for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>autumn’s biggest holiday.</a> “Y’all already know my hottieween party abt to bet [sic] LIT this year,” she wrote. “I can’t wait to see <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>everyone’s costume.</a>”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Megan shared a few photos of the original character in between photos of herself in a<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> separate Instagram post,</a> which she captioned with a line from the move. “Pain has a face. Allow me to show you. Gentlemen I am pain,” she wrote along with a blood drop emoji and the hashtag “Hottieween.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Megan-Thee-Stallion-hellraiser-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Hopefully, Megan has many more amazing costumes to show up before Halloween officially hits! The “Savage” rapper has shown off plenty of other amazing outfits during her recent tour. She sported<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> black velvet lingerie</a>, covered in rhinestones, as well as a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>black and white corset,</a> for a show in Austin earlier in October. Towards the end of September, she also dressed as both a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> sexy coach and cheerleader</a> for an all new ad from Nike. Although of all of these, her&nbsp;Hellraiser&nbsp;look seemed the most <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fitting for Halloween!</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FuZqadl5a7bsDHnpxmq6SWua21zqdkqaGenbKisIyhmKWkn6yyprqMnKasrKWism5%2Bj2toZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-blunt-red-carpet-5381690.html><span>←</span><span>Emily Blunt's Best Red Carpet Looks Through the Years</span></a>
