Brown, who had already decided to play tennis instead of football or handball, was dissatisfied with the conditions in Jamaica, and his parents agreed to return to Germany.

Following this title, Dustin has recorded another 15 ITF double titles. In July 2007, he won his first singles ITF title in Romerberg, Germany against Ruben Bemelmans in straight sets. Dustin has won two more ITF titles Browns’ first ATP Challenger title in single came in 2009 in Samarqand, Uzbekistan when he beat Jonathan Dasnières de Veigy in two sets. In 2010, Dustin defeated Izak van der Merwe on a hard surface and Igor Sijslingon a carpet to claim two more titles, while he also won one in each of 2012, 2013, and 2014. His most recent single title came in 2016 against Lu Yen-hsun in Manchester, UK, but he has won 17 ATP challengers in doubles, the most recent one in Las Vegas, USA when he and Carsten Ball defeated Dean O’Brien and Ruan Roelofse.</p><p>Brown has participated in Grand Slams on seven occasions, and his biggest achievement is the third round at Wimbledon in 2015, when he upset Rafael Nadal in the second round, before suffering a 3-1 defeat to Viktor Troicki. He also reached the third round in 2013, but other than that, his Grand Slam results have been disappointing.</p><p>Dustin took part in the Summer Olympics in Rio in 2016 but lost in the opening round to Thomaz Bellucci despite having a 6-4, 4-4 lead – he injured his ankle and was forced to retire in tears.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, there are no public details of his relationships, but Dustin Brown currently lives in Winsen an der Aller, Germany.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$300,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 8, 1984</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Brooklyn, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.96 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>78 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>German tennis player</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Ithaca High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>German</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Nicole Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Dustin Brown, Jake Brown, Mackenzie Brown, Cooper Brown, Mason Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Inge Brown, Leroy Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Brandon Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/Dustin-Brown-Tennis-114877435241415</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/dreddytennis</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/dreddy_ja/</td></tr></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1frLWwecisZJ2to6m2r3nBq6awpl2osqZ5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpedCupq2dXZbEor7DrGSfmZOperi1yqJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tobin-bell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tobin Bell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
