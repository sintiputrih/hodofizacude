Soldier, Call of Duty: Ghosts&nbsp;(2013) as&nbsp;Thomas A. Merrick, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare&nbsp;(2016) as HAVOC and as Lieutenant Joseph Turner in Call of Duty: WWII&nbsp;which was unveiled on Wednesday, April 26, 2017, during a Livestream event that culminated in a stunning trailer.</p><p>Activision confirmed the World War II setting over social media, but <strong>Josh Duhamel</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Tucker</strong>, and Jeffrey Pierce were on hand as the players got the first look at gameplay footage. The actors’ voices and likeness are used for characters.</p><p>The story of&nbsp;WWII centers on ordinary men who become soldiers and fight their way through occupied France, Belgium, and the Rhine as members of the 1st Infantry Division. While the bulk of the game will focus on the years 1944-1945, it’ll touch upon the years 1940-1944, a time when Allied forces were gathering strength against Germany. The beaches of Normandy and the Paris liberation were two of the mission highlights revealed.</p><p>Glen Schofield, co-founder and studio head of Sledgehammer Games, said in a statement, “The story&nbsp;Call of Duty: WWII follows a global and diverse cast, but for me, it honors my father, Ronald ‘Red’ Daniels, and his squad, and not just what they went through from a global perspective, but what they went through personally. We like to tell a story within a story, and this is no different.”</p><p>As part of the reveal, the first multiplayer details were announced, including the “objective-based, narrative-driven” mode dubbed “War.” Divisions will replace Character Classes, and players will be able to “rally and interact” with each other in the Headquarters in between missions. More will be revealed at this year’s E3 in Los Angeles from June 13-15. An added surprise, Activision teased the game’s “Nazi Zombies” mode with a singular image. Details are still under wraps.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeffrey-pierce-the-last-of-us></span><span>Jeffrey Pierce The Last of Us</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><i>The Last of Us Part II</i>&nbsp;is an upcoming&nbsp;action-adventure game&nbsp;developed by&nbsp;Naughty Dog&nbsp;and published by&nbsp;Sony Interactive Entertainment&nbsp;for the&nbsp;PlayStation 4. Set five years after the events of&nbsp;<i>The Last of Us</i>&nbsp;(2013), players enter the role of 19-year-old&nbsp;Ellie, who comes into conflict with a mysterious cult in the post-apocalyptic&nbsp;United States. The game contains&nbsp;survival horror&nbsp;elements and is played from the&nbsp;third-person perspective. Players can use firearms,&nbsp;improvised weapons, and&nbsp;stealth&nbsp;to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the&nbsp;<i>Cordyceps</i>&nbsp;fungus.</p><p>The six-year development of&nbsp;<i>Part II</i>&nbsp;began in 2014, soon after the release of&nbsp;<i>The Last of Us Remastered</i>.&nbsp;Neil Druckmann returns as a creative director&nbsp;whilst&nbsp;Gustavo Santaolalla&nbsp;returns to compose and perform the score. It was announced in December 2016 and delayed twice, first for further development and then due to logistical problems arising from the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic. The game is scheduled for release on June 19, 2020. It received universal acclaim by critics.</p><p>In&nbsp;<i>The Last of Us</i>, he provides the English voice of&nbsp;Tommy, originally having auditioned for the character&nbsp;Joel, Tommy’s brother. He reprises his role as Tommy in <i>The Last of Us Part II</i>. It was rather ironic for Pierce to play the younger brother due to him being a few years older than&nbsp;Troy Baker, who played the older brother, Joel. Onset though, Baker recalled that “it felt like [they] were brothers”, making it easier to perform in their scenes together.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeffrey-pierce-movies-and-tv-shows></span><span>Jeffrey Pierce Movies and Tv Shows</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=film></span>Film<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>1997 The Others</li><li>1998 Houdini</li><li>2000 Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis</li><li>2002 Astronauts</li><li>2002 Random Shooting in L.A.</li><li>2002 S1m0ne</li><li>2003 The Foreigner</li><li>2005 Final Approach</li><li>2008 Long Island Confidential</li><li>2010 Alphonso Bow</li><li>2010 The Space Between</li><li>2011 The Double</li><li>2012 Any Day Now</li><li>2013 The Stranger Within</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=television></span>Television<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>1997 Pacific Blue</li><li>1998 Profiler</li><li>2001 Big Apple</li><li>2002 The West Wing</li><li>2002–03 For the People</li><li>2003 Without a Trace</li><li>2003 Judging Amy</li><li>2003 JAG</li><li>2003 Boston Public</li><li>2004 Charmed</li><li>2005 Charlie Jade</li><li>2005 Crossing Jordan</li><li>2005 NCIS</li><li>2006–07 The Nine</li><li>2007 Close to Home</li><li>2007 Journeyman</li><li>2007 Life</li><li>2008 Eli Stone</li><li>2008 Criminal Minds</li><li>2008 Fear Itself</li><li>2008 Private Practice</li><li>2008 Knight Rider</li><li>2009 Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</li><li>2009 Castle</li><li>2010 Day One</li><li>2010 NCIS: Los Angeles</li><li>2010 Miami Medical</li><li>2012 CSI</li><li>2012 Alcatraz</li><li>2012 Nikita</li><li>2013 Cult</li><li>2013–14 The Tomorrow People</li><li>2014 Drop Dead Diva</li><li>2014 The Night Shift</li><li>2015 Justified</li><li>2017 Bosch</li><li>2018 Castle Rock</li><li>2019 God Friended Me</li><li>2019 Love, Death & Robots</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=video-games></span>Video games<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>2008 The Bourne Conspiracy</li><li>2009 Prototype</li><li>2010 Medal of Honor</li><li>2011 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</li><li>2012 Medal of Honor: Warfighter</li><li>2013 The Last of Us</li><li>2013 Call of Duty: Ghosts</li><li>2016 Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</li><li>2017 Call of Duty: WWII</li><li>2020 The Last of Us Part II</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeffrey-pierce-salary></span><span>Jeffrey Pierce Salary</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Details about Pierce’s salary are not yet disclosed.
