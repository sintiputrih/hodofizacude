Yes, we've looked at business laptops before, but this laptop wasn't sent by Dell; instead, it comes via Intel and it's going to be our reference point for Sandy Bridge comparisons next month. When Intel initially contacted us about getting a "reference Arrandale platform" in hands so we could test various applications and games, they suggested the <a href=#>Lenovo ThinkPad T410</a>. Since we already reviewed that laptop and knew what to expect, we asked for an alternative: Dell's Latitude E6410. Targeting the same business class user, it has many similarities to the ThinkPad line, both good and bad. Intel specifically wanted to send us an IGP-only laptop, so our review will be a bit more focused than usual, and our main purpose today is to see what we think of the E6410 compared to other business laptops. Here's what we're looking at today.</p><table align=center border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=565><tbody readability=22.70607028754><tr readability=2><td align=center class=contentwhite colspan=2><strong>Dell Latitude E6410 Specifications</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5-520M<br>(2x2.4GHz, 2.93GHz Turbo, 32nm, 3MB L3, 35W)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chipset</strong></td><td>Intel QM57</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>2x2GB DDR3-1066 (Max 2x4GB)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>Intel HD Graphics</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>14.1" LED Anti-Glare 16:10 WXGA+ (1440x900)<br>(AU Optronics B141PW04 Panel)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Hard Drive(s)</strong></td><td>160GB 5400RPM<br>(Western Digital Scorpio Blue WD1600BEVT-75A23T0)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Optical Drive</strong></td><td>DVD+/-RW Drive (TEAC DV18SA)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Networking</strong></td><td>Gigabit Ethernet (Intel 82577LM)<br>Wireless 802.11n (Intel WiFi 6300AGN)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Audio</strong></td><td>HD Audio (Intel IDT 92HD81B1C5)<br>Stereo speakers, headphone and microphone jacks</td></tr><tr readability=5><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>6-Cell, 11.1V, ~5100mAh, 60Wh battery</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Front Side</strong></td><td>Flash reader<br>Latch release</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Left Side</strong></td><td>Smartcard reader (optional)<br>Exhaust vent<br>1 x USB 2.0<br>1 x eSATA/USB 2.0 combo<br>VGA<br>Kensington lock</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Right Side</strong></td><td>ExpressCard/54 (optional PC Card)<br>Mini 1394a FireWire<br>Optical drive<br>Wireless On/Off switch<br>Headphone and microphone jacks<br>2 x USB 2.0</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Back Side</strong></td><td>Modem (optional)<br>Ethernet jack<br>DisplayPort<br>AC plug</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>Windows 7 Professional 64-bit</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Dimensions</strong></td><td>13.2" x 9.4" x 1.0"-1.2" (WxDxH)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>4.5 lbs</td></tr><tr readability=5><td><strong>Extras</strong></td><td>HD Webcam (Optional)<br>83-Key keyboard<br>Flash reader (MMC, SD, MS, xD)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Warranty</strong></td><td>3-year standard warranty</td></tr><tr readability=1.5949367088608><td><strong>Pricing</strong></td><td><a href=#>Starting at $699</a> (with $261 instant savings)<br>Cost as configured: ~$1200</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Packing a standard dual-core Intel setup, the E6410 specs are what you'd expect of a modern business laptop. Our particular setup came with a Core i5-520M; that CPU is no longer an option on Dell's site, though you can still find it in the FastTrack C2 version. (Our unit is closer to the FastTrack C4A, as it includes the LCD panel upgrade.) If you custom configure the E6410, you can choose between the i3-380M (2.53GHz but no Turbo), i5-460M (2.53GHz base with 2.80GHz Turbo), i5-560M (2.66GHz base with 3.2GHz Turbo), or the top-end i7-640M (2.80GHz base and 3.46GHz Turbo). Given the cost of most upgrades, typical users will be fine with the i3-380M or i5-460M. Mix in the standard options on most of the other components and you have a laptop that should perform well in most tasks that don't need a better GPU than Intel's HD Graphics.</p><p>One thing we do have to note is that the entry-level model priced at $699 is a bit of a joke, shipping with a 160GB hard drive and only 1GB DDR3 memory. The cost to upgrade to 2x2GB DDR3 is a rather exorbitant $145, and most of the other upgrades are very expensive as well. If you get a good sale, things might be better, but count on a reasonable build costing around $900 to $1000 minimum. The one upgrade we do like is the 1440x900 LCD; sure, contrast ratio isn't great, but at least we're not stuck with a 16:9 768p glossy panel. As a whole, the C4A FastTrack (i5-540M, WXGA+, Quadro NVS 3100, 4GB DDR3, and 250GB HDD) is a good blend of performance and features, <a href=#>currently going for $1279</a>, but as we mentioned we're running an IGP-only setup so we have a bit of a special case.</p><p>As a business centric laptop, there are plenty of security features and other upgrades available. Most of these won't matter much to home users—TPM modules, contactless Smartcard readers, FIPS fingerprint scanners, etc. are merely added cost. There are a few nice extras however, like the inclusion of Firewire, ExpressCard/54 (or even the old PC Card if you prefer, again mostly for businesses), and eSATA; there's no USB 3.0 however. Dell has also been a big proponent of DisplayPort since its inception, so they provide a DisplayPort connection on the rear, VGA on the side, but no HDMI or DVI. Finally, the standard warranty is 3-years instead of the regular 1-year warranty we see on most consumer laptops.</p><p>If we were to look solely at pricing and features, the Latitude E6410 costs more than your typical home laptop, but we can't ignore all of the extras Dell provides. Basically, even if you're using it as a consumer laptop, you're stuck with business pricing. One thing that doesn't show up looking at the specifications is the build quality and overall durability, which is yet another benefit of business notebooks. So let's move on to the user experience of the E6410 to see how it holds up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIFxgJNom56knGK5osDIraydnV2ag3V9j2akoqaUnruoecinq56ko2Kvtr%2FIp5ysqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daryl-hall-net-worth-how-rich-is-the-musician.html><span>←</span><span>Daryl Hall net worth: How rich is the musician?</span></a>
