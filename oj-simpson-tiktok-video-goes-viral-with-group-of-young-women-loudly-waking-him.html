Furthermore, it has elicited some amusing replies from online users.</p><h2>OJ Simpson Viral TikTok Video</h2><p>“Let’s wake up OJ at 1am,” is scrawled over the video. A group of 20 to 30-year-old ladies approach Simpson’s room, where he is seen sleeping, in the footage. They yell and make a lot of noise to wake him up. A guy videotaped the footage, and his voice could be heard stating,</p><p>“Let’s go, it’s time to party in the home!” It’s time to get up, let’s get up, let’s get up.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OJ-Simpson-2.jpg alt="OJ Simpson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When a shirtless Simpson awoke and perched on the edge of his bed, all the other ladies burst out laughing and yelling.&nbsp;One lady was observed listening to music on her phone, while another with blonde hair yelled, “Wakey!
