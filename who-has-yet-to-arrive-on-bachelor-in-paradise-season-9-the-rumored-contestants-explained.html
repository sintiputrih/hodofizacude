While Davia’s life hasn’t always been easy, she’s always persevered and is ready to receive the love she has given to so many others in her life. Davia loves dancing, listening to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lizzo</a> and reading romance novels like The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Davia is ready for marriage, and wants it soon! “She is looking for an honest man who will prioritize their relationship above all else,” her official bio for The Bachelor reads, ultimately proving that she is as relatable as can be.

This endearing, self-described goofball is going to give everything he’s got for love. As a partner, Taylor is a trusting guy who has confidence he’ll find the right person someday. Even though he may not always go above and beyond with romantic gestures, Taylor will surprise his partner with breakfast in bed or a cup of coffee before she wakes up. After work, he can be found taking his miniature schnauzer, Alfred, for a walk” — how cute is that?</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>While he may not be remembered from his time on The Bachelorette, just like Peter Cappio, Bachelor In Paradise may be the 32-year-old’s perfect opportunity to get the recognition he deserves (as well as true love).</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Michael Barbour</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Michael-Barbour-1.png><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>With his adorable dimples and top-notch sense of humor, how could you forget about <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Barbour</a></strong> from Charity Lawson’s season of The Bachelorette?</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Eliminated in episode four, “Michael is ready to set sail on his journey for love” for the second time, this time on Bachelor In Paradise.</p><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=847 data-injectable=true>According to his official bio for The Bachelorette, “This yacht captain considers himself a romantic who puts time into the little things, often showering his partner with sentimental gifts. He believes if a woman feels safe and taken care of, the energy will be reciprocated tenfold. Although he grew up an only child, this Chicago-based charmer is also very family oriented and wants to have a big family someday. When he’s not working on his yacht, he’s spending time with his beloved grandfather in the off season.”</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>Given the fact that Michael is a barrel of fun, we know that he is about to have a blast on the shores of Mexico.</p><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>Will the 29-year-old meet the love of his life along the way?

Jordan is looking for someone who is sincere, passionate and supportive, and while he loves the hustle and bustle of his fun life, Jordan is very much looking to settle and start a family. This time next year, he’s hoping when he crosses the finish line, his future wife is there waiting for him,” his official bio for The Bachelorette reads.</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>To jog your memory, Jordan was eliminated on a one-on-one date with Rachel on The Bachelorette, however, this is not the end of their love story…</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Within the first 40 seconds of the trailer for Bachelor In Paradise season 9</a>, we see Rachel share a passionate kiss with the 28-year-old. “This is crazy, getting a second chance.
