The game came from some of the minds behind the greatest games of all time, such as Metroid Prime and Mega Man. While the final product stumbled in a few ways, <a href=#>as detailed in our review</a>, it had some interesting and unique elements to it that have helped build a niche audience. Now that group is getting excited about either ReCore 2 or something else big around the corner, thanks to some teasing by the developer.</p><p>Announced via <a href=#>the official Twitter</a> account of the game, there’s apparently some big news coming on August 20th about the future of ReCore. “Hey ReCore players! Come back to our channels on August 20th to hear what’s next for ReCore! Thank you for waiting & see you then.”</p><p>This doesn’t necessarily mean we are about to see the announcement of ReCore 2. The loose phrasing of “what’s next” for the franchise means this could be a big update or the release of some DLC. We’ll all have to wait for August 20th to find out what the developer has in store.</p><p>Hopefully they’ve taken notes on the criticism that the first game received. While it had major problems, it also brought back some great gameplay mechanics that gamers have been wanting to revisit.</p><p style=color:#ff4343;font-size:14px;font-style:italic></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfo7K4v46rnJynopp6c3nCqKSippdiwamxjJ2cr2WYlsBurYyboKBlkaO7sMHNnJymnZ6peqe70WaYrp%2BlqMFufo%2Btn2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lindsay-lohan-poses-in-pink-underwear-for-halloween-w447498.html><span>←</span><span>Lindsay Lohan Poses in Pink Underwear for Halloween</span></a>
