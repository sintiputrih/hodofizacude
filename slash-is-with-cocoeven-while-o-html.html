Watching the performance, you can see the cameras do anything they can not to get a close-up of the traitorous pin, which must have been a huge embarrassment to Leno, who seems to be grimacing as he introduces the song. Considering that many of the shots selected are so sloppy (catching other cameras in the shot), it seems likely that the show was edited to expunge all glimpses of Conan’s martyred head. (Though around 40:11 in the video below you can get a glimpse of it.) We called the Tonight Show, however, and a spokesperson responded, “We did not edit anything out of the performance,” and Slash’s reps didn’t respond to calls for comment. You be the judge.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Slash is With Coco….Even While on Leno</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloaWdgaXy0uMCsn5iho5TEqsDHmJqom5%2Baw6a6vrCfoqSVlLxvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paige-spiranac-ensemble-maxim-cover-for-sexiest-woman-alive.html><span>←</span><span>SEXIEST WOMAN ALIVE: Paige Spiranac SIZZLES in see-through outfit as she celebrates Maxim cover</span></a>
