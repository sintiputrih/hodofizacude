The anti-hero gives the Daywalker a hilariously fourth-wall breaking welcome, commenting: “Been in any good movies lately? Last I saw, you were huntin’ Parker Posey and some sexy dude…” Marvel fans will know this a nod to 2005’s&nbsp;Blade: Trinity,&nbsp;in which Reynolds played Hannibal King.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Deadpool-Strikeforce-7.jpg><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Like Deadpool says, this is the last time Blade appeared on the big screen. However, that’ll change over the next few years. Kevin Feige announced at Comic-Con last summer that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mahershala Ali has signed up</a> to play the lead in a&nbsp;reboot. Hopes are high that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wesley Snipes will return</a> in some capacity, too, seeing as he’s so tied up with the character. In fact, Wade Wilson himself is due to be folded into the MCU soon, as well. Meaning there’s a chance that Reynolds’ <strong>Deadpool</strong> could actually deliver a similar meta-joke like this in a future team-up movie.</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=87 data-injectable=false>For more, check out the description for Strikeforce #7,&nbsp;which is available now, below:</p><p>SHOWDOWN ON DEADPOOL’S MONSTER ISLAND! There are still hundreds of shape-shifting Vridai sneaking their way through Midgard – and Strikeforce is the only team that can recognize them. But when Blade and his team go hunting on King Deadpool’s Monster Island, they’ll find the worst monsters of all may be the ones in the mirror!</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Neither&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blade</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadpool 3</a></strong>&nbsp;have been given release dates, but it’s possible that both could be with us in 2022. Stay tuned for more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX5myorDPqKalZZ2awaJ50Z6dnqqVo7CmedGymKdloprGr7vLnapmmpyWsaZ506ugp6Gkrnqku8yimmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beyonce-daughter-blue-ivy-epic-then-and-now-super-bowl-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Beyonc's daughter Blue Ivy's then-and-now Super Bowl photos will leave you doing a double take</span></a>
