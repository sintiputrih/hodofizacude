The fight was evenly matched as the ‘Funkmaster’ took lead in the middle rounds, whereas ‘No Mercy’ was able to reclaim the fight in the championship rounds. However, at last, the victory was awarded to Sterling.</p><p>In a newly unearthed closeup video, White was seen disgusted by the scorecard just before Sterling was announced as the undisputed bantamweight champion of the world.

Dana White made his opinion clear in the post-fight presser and ripped the judges for the controversial decision as well.</p><p>“I thought that the judges blew that one. I had it 3-2 the other way. I don’t know how you guys scored it. I guess it’s all in how you score that first round.”</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY- <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Five potential opponents for Aljamain Sterling after maiden title defense at UFC 273 against Petr Yan</a></strong></p><p>What are your thoughts on the decision?
