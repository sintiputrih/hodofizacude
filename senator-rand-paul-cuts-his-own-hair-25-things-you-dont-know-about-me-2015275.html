Spoiler alert: He likes root beer floats and cutting his own hair!</p><p>1. My wife [<strong>Kelley</strong>, 51] and I met at an outdoor oyster roast in Atlanta. At first, she thought I was much younger than I actually was and she gave me the cold shoulder. Eventually she realized that I was 26 years old, and we hit it off!</p><p>2. As a child, I loved to collect old coins with my grandmother.&nbsp;</p><p>3. The same grandmother inspired me to become an ophthalmologist. As her vision began to fade, I became her eyes when we inspected mint marks on coins.&nbsp;</p><p>4. I am the father of three: <strong>William</strong>, 22, <strong>Duncan</strong>, 19, and <strong>Robert</strong>, 16. When they were little kids, I loved coaching their soccer, baseball, and basketball leagues.&nbsp;</p><p>5. My son turned me on to <strong>Sundy Best</strong>, a country duo from Prestonsburg, Kentucky. Check them out!</p><p>6. As you have probably heard by now, I am my own barber. In fact, I cut my own hair on my wedding day, which is evident in our wedding photos.&nbsp;</p><p>7. Mostly I watch the news, but I do like reruns of The Twilight Zone.&nbsp;</p><p>8. I grew up swimming and, as a teenager, I taught swim lessons to make extra spending money.&nbsp;</p><p>9. I was a collegiate swimmer at Baylor University. I still enjoy swimming as a way to keep in shape.&nbsp;</p><p>10. I studied hard and scored high enough on the MCATs to be admitted to Duke University’s medical school without a bachelor’s degree.&nbsp;</p><p>11. Some would say I have a green thumb. I love working in the yard on my days off. Mowing the lawn is very therapeutic for me.&nbsp;</p><p>12. Each summer, members of Congress host a congressional baseball game to raise money for charity. I have played on the Republican team every year since I have been in office. My position: outfield!</p><p>13. I’m not an expert stargazer, but I can recognize many of the constellations and am always interested to see the next eclipse.&nbsp;</p><p>14. I planted a cherry tree in our front yard in Bowling Green, Kentucky, from seeds that came from the cherry trees along the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C.</p><p>15. Before I ran for office, I was an ophthalmologist in Bowling Green. I still conduct pro bono surgeries in Kentucky and abroad. Last year, I went to Guatemala. This year, I’ll travel to Haiti.&nbsp;</p><p>16. My given name is Randal. Kelley started calling me Rand, and it stuck!</p><p>17. My favorite drink? Root beer float.&nbsp;</p><p>18. I am responsible for cooking the Thanksgiving Day turkey. I have a special recipe that involves placing fresh herbs under the skin, covering the turkey in cheesecloth, and basting it in Madeira wine and butter. It’s a labor of love.&nbsp;</p><p>19. I love biking. On a weeknight, you can find me biking around our neighborhood. It’s a great way to unwind.&nbsp;</p><p>20. There’s a bald eagle that lives in a high nest across the pond from my backyard.&nbsp;</p><p>21. A rare hobby of mine: composting! Because of my composting, I guess I qualify as a “crunchy-con.”</p><p>22. I am the author of three books: The Tea Party Comes to Washington, Government Bullies, and&nbsp;Taking a Stand.&nbsp;</p><p>23. My favorite book is The Brothers Karamazov by <strong>Fyodor Dostoyevsky</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>24. Growing up, my parents did not enforce a curfew. They believed excessive rules can have unintended consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>25. One thing I never travel without: my Ray-Ban sunglasses. It’s important to protect your eyes from the sun.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul</strong><strong> </strong>announced his candidacy for the 2016 election on April 7, and the GOP candidate tells <strong>Us</strong> his stance:</p><p><span>FOR:&nbsp;</span></p><p>Term limits and a Read the Bills Act</p><p>Criminal-justice reform</p><p>A balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution</p><p><span>AGAINST:</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The National Security Agency’s surveillance program</p><p>Affordable Care Act</p><p>The current $18 trillion U.S. national debt.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZ6WwbC%2BjKuYp5xdpa62uIycrK2rXZ22tHnOsKVmoJGev25%2BlGaroaGenMBuxc6uZJ2nnql6rLrOsGSamp%2BqwW65xGZpaWllZ4R2ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samsung-galaxy-s-iii-review-att-and-tmobile-usa-variants.html><span>←</span><span>Performance Analysis - Samsung Galaxy S III Review</span></a>
