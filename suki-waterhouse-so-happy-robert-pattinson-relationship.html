The British actress, who started dating Robert in 2018, admitted that she’s “shocked that I’m so happy with someone for nearly five years.” Suki and Robert are <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>extremely private about their relationship</a>, but Suki finally gave some intel about their love story in the new interview, which was to promote her upcoming Amazon show <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daisy Jones & The Six</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Suki-Waterhouse-Happy-Robert-Pattinson-Rare-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Suki also said about Robert, “I’m always incredibly excited when I see his name pop up [on my phone] or even a text, and I think he feels the same about me. “We’ve&nbsp;always got so much to say, and I find him hilarious.”&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Batman</a>&nbsp;star’s girlfriend even revealed if they give each other acting advice. “Rob definitely isn’t getting advice from me about acting, but of course I’ll try and get him to help me with an audition before he falls asleep on the sofa,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Suki-Waterhouse-Happy-Robert-Pattinson-Rare-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Before dating Robert, Suki was in relationships with musician <strong>Miles Kane</strong> and actors&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bradley Cooper </strong></a>and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Diego Luna</a></strong>. She told the&nbsp;Sunday Times&nbsp;that she wrote her music after experiencing a “colossal breakup”, seemingly with one of those men, but confirmed that she’s now “utterly healed”. Suki also opened up about what it’s like being labeled “the girlfriend” of a famous partner. “You can’t expect the world to just be graciously understanding of everything,” Suki said. “When you’re 21 you go headfirst into things and you’ve absolutely no idea what the repercussions are.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Robert and Suki’s relationship became public knowledge in July 2018, when they were spotted engaging in some PDA during a late-night stroll. They each stayed tight-lipped about their relationship even&nbsp;when a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sunday Times</a>&nbsp;reporter asked Robert about Suki in an April 2019 interview. “Do I have to [talk about her]?” the Twilight&nbsp;star responded, before saying that “if&nbsp;you let people in, it devalues what love is.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It’s unclear if Robert and Suki have gotten engaged. They <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sparked engagement rumors</a> back in January 2020, when Suki wore a gold band on her ring finger to a Dior party in Paris. It’s been over three years since the rumors began and still nothing’s been confirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5FqZqytm556uK3Tnqmhp6Wosm6%2Fzmafmqigrnqzu8Geqa1loJbBtbXNrKanZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-ashley-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>John Ashley Net Worth</span></a>
