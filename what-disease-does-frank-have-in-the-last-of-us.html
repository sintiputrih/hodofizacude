We also see the motor function in his upper body has deteriorated substantially, along with his ability to paint as seen clearly in his portrait of Bill. The third clue would be Frank mentioning that the ailment is incurable.</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>On <a href=#>HBO’s The Last of Us Podcast</a>, showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed that Frank suffered from a neurodegenerative condition, which was either multiple sclerosis (MS) or early Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), however he notes that he did not want to specify which exact disease it was. While Frank’s speech was not yet impaired, both conditions eventually affect facial nerves and muscles, which is perhaps why Frank chose to end his life.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>A similar narrative thread was seen in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scrubs</a> season seven episode six, titled ‘My Number One Doctor,’ in which an ALS patient named Shannon attempts to self-euthanize while they are still able to use their upper extremities.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ2ho5qutLGMnaaeq12bv6K6ymafmq6VYravedOhnGakkajBbrvFZqysZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kodak-black-pics-rapper-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Pics Of The Rapper Hollywood Life</span></a>
