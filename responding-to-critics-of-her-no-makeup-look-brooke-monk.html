<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Responding to Critics Of Her No-Makeup Look, Brooke Monk</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Being a celebrity has benefits and drawbacks, and Brooke Monk, who is only 18 years old, is fully aware of both. In October 2019, she started using TikTok, and she immediately became well-known. She has 16 million followers on TikTok alone as of this writing. Her YouTube channel has more than 724K subscribers, and she has 1.6M followers on her own Instagram account.</strong></p><p>In addition to her perfect looks, Monk was praised for her sympathetic writing. Nevertheless, she has faced some criticism, particularly for her appearances without makeup.</p><h2>Brooke Monk I Reacted to Insulting Remarks</h2><p>The online sensation has always been obsessed with makeup, but she didn’t start wearing full-face makeup until she was 15 years old. She enthusiastically shared her enthusiasm on social media. Most of Monk’s content shows her with makeup on, including her very popular foxy eyes with long lashes and heavy eye shadow. Her makeup is admired and imitated by many of her TikTok fans.</p><p>On<strong> May 13, 2021</strong>, a day after showcasing her face without makeup in a tutorial video, she debuted her no-makeup looks on TikTok, but she didn’t receive the same response.<br>The style on Monk’s eyelid prevented her from applying makeup, as she revealed in the 30-second film.</p><p>As soon as she posted the video, her fans were split between admirers and critics. People claimed that without her makeup, she was nothing. One observer stated, “She is overrated. Another person questioned, “Have you seen her without makeup?”</p><p>The boy responded with another video as criticism poured in on the video’s comment area. When Monk first revealed her face in its natural state, she wrote about how lovely she felt without makeup. She then presented the critics’ remarks and slapped back, telling them everything they had said was false.</p><p>Her admirers were eager to express their support in the comments section. “You’re stunning beyond belief. One of them added, “Don’t listen to the haters who are jealous of your success. Another person said, “Be yourself in whatever you are naturally beautiful at.” Leenda Dong, a fellow TikTok star, remarked, “With or without, you still look like Disney princess Mah friend.” Monk thanked the social media star for her motivating remarks.</p><h2>Sam Zigg and Brooke Monk are dating.</h2><p>Monk is creating a stir with her gorgeous appearance and her connection to model and TikTok sensation Sam Dezz. The duo is the quintessential “it” couple on social media. On <strong>March 7, 2021,</strong> Dezz spoke with Celeb Secrets TV about their relationship and that it was “a classic 2020 relationship.” They started corresponding on Snapchat in 2020 after Monk secretly entered his DM and added him as a buddy.</p><p>For months, they spoke every evening. Then, all of a sudden, Monk asked him if he wanted to hang out with her because she was heading to Los Angeles. The ambitious model consented, and the two enjoyed some time together before going their ways. They formalized their partnership a week later.</p><p>The couple has since been enjoying their romance while producing material and winning people over with their charming chemistry.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Tantoo Cardinal’s Wife, Kids, And Family</a></strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kelsea Ballerini- Net worth, Bio, Husband, Height, Career</a></h3>Where was Kelsea Ballerini?
