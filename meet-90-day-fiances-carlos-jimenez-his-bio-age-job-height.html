Now, let us tell you in this writing who Carlos is, his age, job, height, family background, relationship with De Juan, and more.</p><h3><strong>90 Day Fiance: Are Carlos Jimenez And De Juan Valentine Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Carlos Jimenez and De Juan Valentine are one of the few other LGBTQ+ couples of this season.</p><p>When they decided to put their personal life out there on&nbsp;90 Day Fiance, the pair had been dating for a year and a half. Yes. They met on the internet during the COVID pandemic. So, meeting face to face for the first time was a challenge for them and it is played out in the show (of course).</p><p>Viewers get to see Valentine travel from the United States to Colombia to meet Carlos. But, because this is their first meeting ever it is not entirely smooth sailing. As they navigate their new romance, Valentine can be heard saying “We are experiencing a lot of growing pains” in the trailer. Meanwhile, Carlos seems worried that he is losing all his independence as a “grown-ass” man.</p><p>So, did Carlos manifest the love of his life, or just learned a really tough lesson?</p><p>The fate of this couple, like every other on the show, was left unanswered; as the trailer explored the hardships and challenges they faced to make their relationship work.</p><p>It was unclear, as of the time of this writing, if Carlos and Valentine ended up being together. Hyping the series, Carlos had taken to share on social media that he is extremely excited about this new season of Love in Paradise. He said he is hoping to enjoy it as much as he and Valentine did while filming. So, maybe there is a happy ending.</p><h3><strong>Carlos Jimenez Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1993, Carlos Jimenez reached the age of 28 in late 2021.</p><h3><strong>Carlos Jimenez Job</strong></h3><p>As of now, not much was revealed about Carlos’s job and career so far. Only that, he is reportedly a social media influencer regularly updating his followers with photos and videos of his fitness regime. When he was not working he seemed to be relaxing at Colombia’s much-loved beaches and national parks.</p><p>One more thing is, that Carlos used to be a customer service representative at Sutherland Colombia, a telecommunication company.</p><h3><strong>Is Carlos Jimenez On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Carlos Jimenez could be found on Instagram <a href=#>@charlyjimenez02</a> and there were 178 posts and 26.7K followers as of 15 June 2022.</p><h3><strong>Carlos Jimenez Height</strong></h3><p>Big and beefily built Carlos Jimenez stands above 5′ 9″ in height. He loves to go to the beach that is near his place to get tanned and to do work out and swim. And of everything workouts are the most important to him because they help him with his personal confidence.</p><p>Back in 2018, Carlos shared a side-by-side photo of himself when he was younger and a current-day mirror selfie. The difference between the two pictures is striking. From it was obvious how much work Carlos has put into transforming his body.</p><h3><strong>Carlos Jimenez Family</strong></h3><p>Growing up, Carlos faced/struggled with so many fears and insecurities. And growing up in a small town surrounded by a lot of conservative people certainly did not help. Referring to his queerness, he said that it was hard for him to show his true colors.</p><p>Carlos was basically afraid that they would find out he was gay. Even until 90 Day Fiance, he was not 100 percent out of the closet. His closest friends knew about it but even his family had no idea. However, during his introduction, he says he is at this point in his life where he just wants to be happy. And that he found this happiness in an “amazing” man named Valentine.</p><p>Anyway, so Carlos will maybe come out to his family in one of the episodes of 90 Day Fiancé: Love in Paradise.</p><p>And so far, the only person we knew from his family was his very young appearing grandmother who celebrates her birthday on the 21st of April. Carlos seemed clearly very fond of her.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Carlos Jimenez Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Carlos Jimenez’s birthday is on the 17th of December. So, he is a Sagittarius and supposedly a material realist.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Carlos Jimenez From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Carlos Jimenez lived in Barranquilla, Colombia when Valentine flew to see him in his country.

Because it has been said and proven time and again that the TLC paychecks for 90 Day Fiance are pretty feeble. They say some members of the cast even do not get paid at all.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpp2VqXp6fIydmLJllp6ur6%2FErGScmaKhvLR5yaKknqaVr3qptdJmmaKnXZa0pnnJqJlmoJWetKnAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lea-michele-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Lea Michele's Parents and What's Happening With Her 'Funny Girl' Role?</span></a>
