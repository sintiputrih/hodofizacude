The former ruler also has a younger brother, Prince Hitachi, and a younger sister, Takako Shimazu.</p><p id=eqez4A1vxJoO data-wc=70>The royal took the name Prince Tsugu during his youth and was evacuated from Tokyo during World War II due to the American military campaign. Due to agnatic primogeniture rules, <strong>Akihito was the heir apparent from his birth, although his investiture as Crown Prince didn't come until a month before his 19th birthday</strong>. One of his first duties as Crown Prince was to attend the coronation of <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>.</p><p id=erPmKdwRvfMU data-wc=70>In August 1957, Akihito met Michiko Shōda on a tennis court, however, due to her seemingly low class and Catholic background, there was no public enthusiasm for his potential bride. However, <strong>with the help of King Baudouin of Belgium, Akihito convinced his family to agree to the union and the pair married on 10 April 1959</strong>. The pair have welcomed three children: Emperor Naruhito, Crown Prince Fumihito and Sayako Kuroda.</p><p id=eoLHi_1CQRMv data-wc=43>Akihito ascended to the throne on 7 January 1989 following the death of his father, and while he was banned from making political statements, he issued statements of remorse to several Asian nations that had been invaded by Japan during his father's reign.</p><p id=egfoqmMNE5Su data-wc=69>During his reign, the royal did his best to bring the Imperial House closer to the Japanese public and made sure to visit all 47 prefectures of Japan. While abdications of emperors had been commonplace, many modern rulers died on the throne, however on 13 July 2016, NHK reported that Akihito was considering abdication due to his advancing age, something he referenced in a speech on 8 August 2016.</p><p id=e8wi_nG31-gl data-wc=59>On 19 May 2017, the Japanese government passed a bill allowing Akihito to abdicate, and in December 2017, the then Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, confirmed that <strong>Akihito would abdicate on 30 April 2019, with Emperor Naruhito succeeding him the day after</strong>.

Due to her status as a commoner and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a Catholic, there were many opponents of her courtship with the Japanese royal, including Akihito's mother, Empress Kōjun. They married on 10 April 1959 and welcomed three children: Emperor Naruhito, Crown Prince Fumihito and Sayako Kuroda.</p><p id=e2KZoVVpGhS data-wc=64><strong>The couple's family proved to break royal traditions, with the pair choosing to raise their children instead of sending them to royal tutors and Michiko chose to breastfeed with her children</strong>. Following Akihito's abdication, Michiko became the Empress Emerita and regularly played instruments alongside her children and she has published a set of poems and children's book, which translates as .</p><p id=eijo888_bvd data-wc=54>Media pressure and alleged negative comments from her mother-in-law gave her mental breakdowns and in the 1960s she lost her voice for seven months.

He became heir apparent to the Chrysanthemum Throne when he was 29 following the death of his grandfather, Emperor Shōwa.</p><p id=e4ujQuFpFV0A data-wc=73>At the age of four, Naruhito was enrolled in an elite Japanese school, graduating in 1982 with a degree in history; the ruler credited his fascination with the subject to his discovery of an ancient roadway on palace grounds during his youth. He later studied at Oxford and would go on to meet many members of European royal families, and during a party for Spain's Infanta Elena in 1986, he met Masako Owada.</p><p id=eA0eE8veyGKp data-wc=42><strong>Naruhito immediately began pursuing her, although his family disapproved of the match, and it took three proposals before Masako agreed to marry him</strong>. On 9 June 1993, the pair married. The couple share a daughter, Princess Aiko, who was born in 2001.</p><p id=eFhin7rPPs1u data-wc=55>Naruhito succeeded his father, Akihito, at midnight on 1 May 2019 following his abdication. His rule is known as Reiwa, and he will take the name of Emperor Reiwa following his eventual death. His enthronement ceremony took place on 22 October 2019 and their first foreign state visit was to the United Kingdom in 2022.</p><h2>Empress Masako</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f1c312041110-empress-masako-imperial-palace.jpg><p id=epLn_D49S0uX data-wc=72>Born as Masako Owada on 9 December 1963, Masako is the current Empress of Japan due to her marriage to Emperor Naruhito, who ascended to the throne in 2019. Masako was born to a senior diplomat and former president of the International Court of Justice and was mostly raised in Moscow and New York City. The family continued moving around including stints in Japan, while Masako eventually concluded her education in Boston.</p><p id=eHLAePCqV48C data-wc=48>After her education, Masako started working at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, <strong>being one of only 28 of 800 applicants to pass the entrance exams</strong>. At a party for Spain's Infanta Elena in November 1986, she met Prince Naruhito, and the Japanese royal became infatuated with her.</p><p id=eqmBtzijoKBF data-wc=53>There were concerns over her suitability as her maternal grandfather was reportedly partially responsible for a major public health scandal that affected the town of Minamata and caused a major outbreak of Minamata disease. Although Masako initially rejected Naruhito, she accepted his third marriage proposal and the pair wed on 9 June 1993.</p><p id=e3QTZ9GUhD0k data-wc=15><strong>Masako sadly suffered a miscarriage in 1999, before giving birth to daughter Aiko in 2001.</strong></p><p id=eT2B7gIn9ASE data-wc=59>Masako lived mostly outside of the public eye between 2004 and 2014 due to mental anguish, that was reportedly caused by not producing a male heir and adjusting to life within the Imperial Family.

His love of wildlife has continued into his royal duties and he serves as the president of the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology and the Japanese Association of Zoological Gardens and Aquariums.</p><p id=ehMINLye2XZl data-wc=38>During his undergraduate studies, Fumihito met Kiko Kawashima, the daughter of an economics professor and the duo walked down the aisle on 29 June 1990.

However, following the birth of Crown Prince Fumihito's son, these discussions were dropped.</p><p id=eJGdYqZYGBKg data-wc=66>Aiko's childhood title is Princess Toshi, and her personal naming broke from tradition, with Naruhito and Masako choosing her name instead of her grandfather, Akihito.
