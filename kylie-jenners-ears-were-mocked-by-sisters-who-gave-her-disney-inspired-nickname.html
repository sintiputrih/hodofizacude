When Kylie brought up the idea of beauty standards, Khloe said she’d constantly speak about Kylie’s ears as she loved them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/07/GettyImages-1252536448-1024x750.jpg><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kylie-jenner-s-ears-were-mocked>Kylie Jenner’s ears were ‘mocked’</h2><p>Kylie revealed her ears were mocked by Khloe and Kourtney when she was a child. She told them they nicknamed her ‘Dopey’ in reference to the character known for his large ears, to which a confused Kourtney asked, “Really?”</p><p>When Khloe said she only spoke about her ears because she “loved” them, Kylie replied, “I didn’t receive it like that. I received it as, like, everyone’s making fun of my ears, calling me Dopey.”</p><p>Kourt questioned her involvement, asking: “Did I?” In response, <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> noted that “everyone” pulled on her ears and made comments about them, before mimicking, “Oh you little Dopey!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-noticed-stormi-has-her-ears>She noticed Stormi has her ears</h2><p>Kourtney remembered the comments she made, reminding Kylie that she was “a little kid.” She replied, “That f***ed me up,” to which Kourt responded back, “Yeah, you never think about it.”</p><p>Kylie then said that she went so far as to avoid wearing her hair up for five years because she didn’t want her ears on show. “I never thought about my ears. And then for like five years, I never wore an updo,” she said.</p><p>Her daughter Stormi made Kylie change her entire outlook on her ears. “And then I had Stormi, and she has my ears. And it made me realize how much I love them,” she said, adding that she sees her as “the most beautiful thing ever.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/07/GettyImages-1486970629-1024x770.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kylie-dons-updo-on-instagram>Kylie dons updo on Instagram</h2><p>Just a day before The Kardashians’ new episode came out, Kylie made a note to share several pictures donning a hair updo, which showed her ears. She held back her hair in what appeared to be an effort to draw attention to them.</p><p>She recently changed her display picture to an image with one ear completely on show, suggesting that she now loves her ears despite revealing her insecurities about them back in 2018.</p><p>Hailey Bieber is Kylie’s biggest fan, commenting, “So pretty,” underneath the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> shared on July 19.
