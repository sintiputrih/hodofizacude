She carried a translucent blue purse, and in some photos, she was seen wheeling out a pair of large boxes, presumably with her cosmetology supplies in them. The transformation was seemingly recent because she was seen in a similar outfit <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>with longer hair</a>, tied back in a ponytail, at cosmetology school back in October.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Besides the hair makeover, Amanda announced that she was undergoing a career change in an October <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story.

Amanda was<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> released from a conservatorship</a> that she was under for nine years in March. After being freed after nearly a decade, the&nbsp;Hairspray&nbsp;star made a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rare public comment</a> thanking fans for their support in a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;“Following today’s decision by the judge to terminate my conservatorship, I would like to thank my fans for their love and well wishes during this time. I would also like to thank my lawyer and my parents for their support over the last nine years,” she said. “In the last several years, I have been working hard to improve my health so that I can live and work independently, and I will continue to prioritize my well-being in this next chapter.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FyZpqlkaOxonnBsqWeq12otbC%2B02afmqGiYrqit8SorZ6qXaW1sMDOaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./naomi-sablan-a-profile-of-the-american-film-industry-professional.html><span>←</span><span>Naomi Sablan: A Profile of the American Film Industry Professional</span></a>
