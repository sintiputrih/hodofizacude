The name is a little out-of-the-box, and with Odell Beckham Jr. now on the squad, people are more curious than ever about the history of the team. So, why are the Cleveland Browns called the Browns? <strong>Scroll down for everything we know!</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why are the Cleveland Browns called the Browns?</h2><p>So it turns out, there is some history behind the team name. The Browns are named after their original coach and co-founder, Paul Brown. But since the Browns isn't a mascot, the team has Brownie the Elf.</p><p>Paul first founded the organization back in 1945, however, their first four seasons were played in the all-American football conference from 1946 until 1949 until it folded.</p><p>They officially joined the NFL in 1950.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In 1953, the other co-founder, Arthur B. McBride, sold the team to a group of businessmen for a whopping $600,000 at the time. After eight years, the team was again sold to a group that was led by a New York advertising executive named Art Modell.</p><p>Art immediately fired coach Paul Brown just before the 1963 season, but (ironically) the team continued to succeed with their running back Jim Brown.</p><p>Even though Paul was gone, the Browns continued as the team name.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many Super Bowls have the Cleveland Browns won?</h2><p>While the Browns won three NFL championships between the 1950s and 1960s, they have yet to win a Super Bowl with the NFL. Even worse, they've never even appeared in the Super Bowl at all.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>B • R • O • W • N • S (2019)</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Cleveland Browns</a> (@clevelandbrowns) on Sep 16, 2019 at 8:25pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are some of the Cleveland Browns' biggest players?</h2><p>Some of the Browns biggest players are Baker Mayfield, Myles Garrett, Odell Beckham Jr., Nick Chubb, Jarvis Landry, and many more.</p><p>The team's most notable players who have since retired are Jim Brown, Otto Graham, Ernie Davis, Don Fleming, and Lou Groza, all of whom have a retired number with the franchise.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When are the Cleveland Browns playing next?</h2><p>The Browns' next game is on Sunday, Sept. 29 at 1 p.m. against the Baltimore Ravens.</p><p>Oddly enough, the Browns almost became a Baltimore team. In 1995, Art Modell announced he'd be taking the team from Cleveland to Baltimore, but the fans and city took legal action against him.</p><p>As a solution, he established the Baltimore Ravens as a new franchise and kept the Browns in Cleveland.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>@bakermayfield ➡️ @drat4</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Cleveland Browns</a> (@clevelandbrowns) on Sep 25, 2019 at 7:03pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the Cleveland Browns' record for the 2019-2020 season so far?</h2><p>The Browns are currently 1-2 for this season, having won against the Jets and lost against the Titans and Rams.
