<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Deepcool Releases Castle 280EX AIO CPU Cooler</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Further expanding its ever-growing list of CPU coolers, Deepcool has announced its new&nbsp;Castle 280EX AIO CPU cooler, a closed loop liquid cooler with a 280 mm radiator. Slotting in between the pre-existing Castle 240EX and 360EX, the 280EX is designed to improve options for users looking for an RGB-infused cooler with a grey cylindrical CPU block.</p><p>The Deepcool Castle EX series is designed&nbsp;with a 3-phase motor intended to improve flow rate and overall cooling performance, but with less operating noise. The latest in the Castle EX range is the 280EX, which uses a 280 mm radiator that's paired with a black sprayed aluminium core, and comes supplied with a pair of 140 mm 400-1600 rpm cooling fans. The new cooler supports all the usual socket types, including Intel's LGA20XX, LGA 1200 and LGA 115x sockets, as well as AMD's TRX40/TR4 and AM4 sockets.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/15898/81oEWLyd6lL._AC_SL1500__575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>One of the Deepcool&nbsp;Castle 280EX's main design traits comes via the CPU block and pump, with a swappable logo plate which allows users to choose between Deepcool's Gamerstorm emblem or a ying-yang symbol. Integrated into the rather bulky looking pump and block is some addressable RGB LED lighting which can be customized through a 3-pin ARGB motherboard header, or with an included RGB controller in the accessories bundle.</p><p>The cooling plate is made from copper for effective heat dissipation, and Deepcool has opted for a larger design with 25% more skived fins, although Deepcool doesn't state which model it is using as a comparison.&nbsp;The larger plate allows better&nbsp;support for the sizable AMD TR4 socket, which has a much larger IHS than smaller processors such as the AMD's Ryzen 3000 series.</p><p>The Deepcool Castle 280EX has an MSRP of <a href=#>$150</a> and is currently available to buy at Amazon. For reference, the larger Castle 360EX is presently available for $158, while the smallest of the now completed trio, the 240EX with 240 mm radiator can be purchased for $130.</p><h3>Related Reading</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH52hJhxZp2dlaWwsLvLZqmepJWWwKa%2FjJyYrKycmnpzhI%2Ber2aZmaR6pLzUZpqop5yavw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-10-best-movies-like-the-help.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 best movies like The Help</span></a>
