"Then, I thought to myself, 'JAY-Z is not going to do a song with somebody named Pardi McFly,'" Pardi told <a href=#>People</a> in November 2019. "So, I just dropped the McFly and I kept the Pardi."</p><p>As for the latter half of his stage name, the UNDER8ED rapper says the name came from a store he would walk past. After doing research, he realized Fontaine was the last name of French poet Jean de la Fontaine, which seemed fitting for him when he came up with his name. The de-facto sex symbol continued, "I used to walk past this Anne Fontaine store all the time, and I didn't know exactly what it meant or what it sold, but I just knew Fontaine sounded hella important." Cut to the late 2000s, and Pardison Fontaine's stage name was born.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGtmZX1xe9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2isqitzWaroZ2VYsC1rculoKimo2K%2FtrnOq5ydZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWWglr%2BltdKopWaen6PBorXNnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bessie-coleman.html><span>←</span><span>The Story Of America's First Black Female Pilot</span></a>
