What we do know is that Barbara Pan survived and was among the victims who later were able to identify Ramirez.</p><p dir=ltr>Following the Pan murder, Mayor Feinstein made the unusual decision to release a sketch of the suspect and describe key evidence that police were searching for, including a pair of Avia sneakers that matched footprints at various crime scenes. Ramirez must have been watching, because he went on to throw those sneakers off the <a href=#>Golden Gate Bridge</a>. But more than evidence was lost; after fleeing the Bay Area, he went on to brutally attack another couple in their bed, as the <a href=#>Orange Counter Register</a>&nbsp;reports. On August 31, 1985, Ramirez (per <a href=#>All That's Interesting</a>) was beaten and subdued by a group of East LA residents who'd recognized him, and held him until police could arrive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FkGxnbWhfrLW6edGimqGZopl6s63Moqmesl2ssq%2FAjK2mZquRo3qnvsCnmqKrk6R6s7XGoatmmpWbvLOxjKGcZq%2BRqHqkrdSgn61n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-hamilton.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Hamilton</span></a>
