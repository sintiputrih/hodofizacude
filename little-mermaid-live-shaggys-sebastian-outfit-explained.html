WHY THEY DO MY MAN LIKE THAT!!” and “Is there a reason why the entire cast is in full costume, but Shaggy is just wearing a red leather jacket?”</p><p>Others compared the look to <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a>‘ in the “Oops I Did It Again” music video. “Shaggy or Britney, who wore it better?” one tweet read.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shaggy in <a href=#>#TheLittleMermaidLive</a> like <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ymntw9PUHh</a></p><p>— Lesley Hauler (@LesleyHauler) <a href=#>November 6, 2019</a></p><p>The comments didn’t get any better when <a href=#><strong>Queen Latifah</strong></a> appeared as Ursula and her black costume was elaborate and incredible. “After seeing all the effort put into Queen Latifah’s Ursula costume, I’m left wondering who Shaggy pissed off at Disney,” one user wrote. Another added, “The whole costume budget for #TheLittleMermaidLive went towards Queen Latifah’s Ursula and I’m 1000% okay with that.”</p><p>He later returned to the stage to perform “Kiss the Girl,” and while he sounded great, the look was distracting. “Not even Shaggy’s Iron Man plastic upper and lightly starched red jeans can ruin ‘Kiss the Girl,'” a fan tweeted.</p><p>However, there was an explanation to why the “Wasn’t Me” singer wasn’t wearing claws.</p><p>“For those wondering, Shaggy wore crab claws in early rehearsals and it looked ridiculous,” SVP of Live Programming at ABC, <strong>Robert Mills</strong>, tweeted during the live show. When one of his followers responded that they thought it looked more Thriller, he wrote, “I thought more Eddie Murphy Delirious.”</p><p>He then shared a photo of the outfit with claws.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>All done.
