It’s good for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married people</a>. It’s good for single people. It’s good for all people. And that’s why we love it when people, especially famous people, aren’t afraid to talk about it. We don’t need celebrities to tell us masturbation is great, but we love it when they’re not afraid to spread the word about it. After all, the more we all normalize and de-stigmatize masturbation, the more we’ll have a culturally positive and informed approach to pleasure (which makes all sex better too!)</p><p>From Chelsea Handler (who’d rather masturbate than meditate) to Jada Pinkett Smith (who talked about the topic with her mom and daughter) to Billie Eilish and more, these celebrities have all gotten real about the importance of self-pleasure.</p><p>Read on, and then see if you don’t get inspired by these <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">six masturbation positions</a> that prove you don’t need a partner to have a good time.</p><p>A version of this story originally appeared in 2016.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.2846153846154><h2>Billie Eilish</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/shampoos-for-fine-hair.jpg><p>Billie Eilish got candid about masturbation in a 2024 <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> cover story, describing self-pleasure as “an enormous, enormous part of my life” and a “huge, huge help” for her <a href=#>body dysmorphia</a> struggles.</p><p>Eilish even revealed her preferred way to masturbate: in front of a mirror. “Partly because it’s hot, but it also makes me have such a raw, deep connection to myself and my body, and have a love for my body that I have not really ever had,” the singer explained. “I have learned that looking at myself and watching myself feel pleasure has been an extreme help in loving myself and accepting myself, and feeling empowered and comfortable.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.9220779220779><h2>Gina Rodriguez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/celebrity-women-talk-about-masturbation-12.jpg><p>A lot of us don’t come into the world realizing that masturbation is fun, healthy and normal, but that journey to acceptance and celebration is something many of us go through. Gina Rodriguez shares that she used to feel guilt and anxiety over her masturbation habits.</p><p>“In all honesty, I used to feel guilty for masturbating,” she told <a href=#>Bust in 2017</a>. “Oh my god, this extreme guilt And that lasted way too long. Or maybe I masturbated too much. It’s OK to look back in retrospect and be like, it wasn’t good that I felt bad about touching myself.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.85><h2>Khloe Kardashian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1397791547-1.jpg><p>Khloe supports self-love so hard she even <a href=#>penned a blog post sharing her best masturbation pro-tips</a>.

I don’t watch her anymore,” she said in a 2008 interview with <a href=#>Complex</a>. “I was masturbating one night to, like, Anal Sex Compilation #3 or whatever and she was in it and I was like, ‘Oh no!’ I had to turn it off. It was horrible.”&nbsp;</p><p>There’s <a href=#>plenty of other porn in the sea</a>, though!&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5923076923077><h2>Gabrielle Union</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/celebrity-women-talk-about-masturbation-08.jpg><p>Gabrielle Union opened up about discovering her clitoris and sexuality young (<a href=#>as many children do!</a>) in her essay collection from 2017, sharing a bit of her story on<a href=# rel=nofollow> Sirius XM’s Sway in the Morning</a>:</p><p>“[When I was five] I used to have an oversized stuffed animal that had like a potbelly, and I’d laid on it. And I was like, ‘whoa, oh, oh, ignition, hello!’ Yeah, I was like, ‘This is awesome if I kinda hump this stuffed animal.’ I just knew that it was amazing. What I was feeling was awesome and I just rolled with it — to this day… Self-love is the best love. [In my book,&nbsp;We’re Going to Need More Wine] I also talk about thinking that because that’s where I thought the fun was, I thought that my clitoris was my vagina. It just never occurred to me to do a deeper dive, because that was amazing.

But why is saying it out loud so weird? Loving yourself should be the most normal thing in the world. We all deserve amazing orgasams, right? So let’s be open about it.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.1165501165501><h2>Halle Berry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/celebrity-women-talk-about-masturbation-06.jpg><p>Ask her anything — really! Halle Berry is up for talking about sex, and if you need proof, just check out her <a href=#>recently relaunched Bash and Booty video series</a>.

I tried with my psychiatrist several times. He made me short recordings and long recordings, and then I’d meditate. Sometimes I’d just masturbate. They both start with m, and your brain lets you relax after each one, so who cares?”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3977433004231><h2>Jada Pinkett Smith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/celebrity-women-talk-about-masturbation-13.jpg><p>If you’re familiar with Jada Pinkett Smith’s Facebook show Red Table Talk, you know she has a no-holds-barred approach to, well, everything. In 2018, <a href=#>she talked about masturbation</a> with her regular show co-stars, mother Adrienne Banfield Norris and daughter Willow Smith — and Pinkett Smith wasn’t afraid to get candid. “I came into [knowledge about sex] differently. My grandmother taught me about self-pleasuring because she wanted me to know that that pleasure was from me,” she said. “She didn’t want me to fall into the hands of a man and if he gave me pleasure to think that that was him. And she taught me at 9 [years old].”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.94486692015209><h2>Eva Longoria</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/celebrity-women-talk-about-masturbation-18.jpg><p>Eva Longoria is so keen to encourage other women to masturbate that she gives sex toys to all her friends. “I didn’t begin enjoying sex until I started masturbating,” she told Self in 2015, per <a href=#>Marca</a>. “Before that, I really wasn’t sexual. I <a href=#>bought my first vibrator</a> three years ago. It’s a shame I didn’t discover it sooner. Now I give Rabbit vibrators to all my girlfriends.&nbsp;They scream when they unwrap it. The best gift I can give them is an orgasm.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Anna Kendrick</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/celebrity-women-talk-about-masturbation-14.jpg><p>Anna Kendrick voiced her approval of masturbation on <a href=#>Twitter</a> in 2013, in her usual hilarious way. “Ugh — NEVER going to a Ryan Gosling movie in a theatre again,” she tweeted. “Apparently masturbating in the back row is still considered ‘inappropriate.’”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9818181818182><h2>Amy Schumer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/celebrity-women-talk-about-masturbation-10.jpg><p>At the 2015 MTV Movie Awards, Amy Schumer told viewers she masturbates&nbsp;and gave a little intel on what — or who — helps her get off. “Magic Mike XXL. It, like, really is magic,” she said, per <a href=#>Mic</a>. “Anytime I watch those guys, at least two of my fingers disappear.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.4971098265896><h2>Taylor Momsen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/celebrity-women-talk-about-masturbation-03.jpg><p>Taylor Momsen doesn’t mince her words when it comes to talking about masturbation. “I’m not a whore for masturbating, so fuck you if you want to call me one,” she said back in 2010, per <a href=#>Us</a>. “I think women should equally be allowed to pleasure themselves as much as men.” Amen.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4452736318408><h2>Amber Rose</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/celebrity-women-talk-about-masturbation-01.jpg><p>Amber Rose isn’t just open about masturbation; she’s giving out tips!

And on&nbsp;The Amber Rose Show&nbsp;in 2016, the model also revealed a surprising benefit of regular masturbation, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Daily Mail</a>: “I masturbate all the time.
