The duo started dating in February 2017 and got engaged two years later in 2019. Their wedding was set to happen in 2020, but was eventually postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their big day, however, never came.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which One Of Jennifer Lopez's Roles Is Her Most Profitable One?</a></span></p><p>In April 2021, Lopez and Rodriguez announced their split, releasing a joint statement on <strong>The Today Show</strong>. “We have realized we are better as friends and look forward to remaining so,” they said. “We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects. We wish the best for each other and one another’s children.” It was not long after this breakup that <a href=#>JLo moved on with her ex, actor Ben Affleck</a>, whom sources have confirmed that she is absolutely in love with. But how has this affected the singer’s relationship with Alex’s two daughters Natasha and Ella? Keep reading to find out.</p><h2 id=sweet-birthday-message-from-jlo-to-ella><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sweet Birthday Message From JLo To Ella</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On April 21, shortly after confirming their split, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JLo took to Instagram to wish Alex’s daughter Ella a happy birthday</a>. The singer shared a black and white picture of herself and Ella sharing a warm hug. “Happy Birthday Ella Bella,” she sweetly captioned.</p><p>The adorable picture showed the strong bond between JLo and Ella and from what we can tell, the singer’s love for the little girl is still growing stronger. Alex also shared a heartwarming montage, celebrating his daughter from her early years, and JLo made several appearances in the video.</p><h2 id=alex-and-his-kids-learned-a-lot-during-his-relationship-with-jlo><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Alex And His Kids Learned A Lot During His Relationship With JLo</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the 17th of August, Alex had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Entertainment Tonight</a> where he spoke about how he was handling his breakup with Jennifer and also more importantly how his daughters were faring seeing that Jennifer played such a big role in their lives. Coming from living together with both of their children, the separation no doubt hit the kids hard but Alex had this to say: “I had five years of an incredible life and partnership and also with my daughters, we learned so much." The former couple has seemingly made it a priority to value the relationship built with their kids even post-breakup.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez's Insane Work Ethic, Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=the-children-played-a-big-role-in-alex-and-jlo-rsquo-s-relationship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Children Played A Big Role In Alex And JLo’s Relationship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer and Alex could have gone their separate ways a lot earlier than they did, but the couple reportedly tried to make it work for the sake of their kids. The singer’s children and Alex’s children share a close bond which sources have said will most likely remain even after their parents’ split.</p><h2 id=they-will-always-be-a-family><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Will Always Be A Family</span></h2><p>Prior to their split, Alex and Jennifer had the ultimate love story, leading up to a beautiful family. However, although the family might now seem to be broken, the former couple has continued to let their kids know that nothing really needs to change. Alex and JLo have allegedly explained to the kids that the only difference is that their parents would now be living in different houses but for them, that apparently changes nothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=j-lo-and-alex-have-continued-to-support-each-other><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>J.Lo And Alex Have Continued To Support Each Other</span></h2><p>Before separating, Alex and JLo went through couples therapy to help them navigate what would soon become the next phase of their lives. During an interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today Show,</a> JLo and Alex said “We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects. We wish the best for each other and one another’s children. Out of respect for them, the only other comment we have to say is thank you to everyone who has sent kind words and support.” This cleared the air as to how their relationship with their kids would be soon after. It was all love and positivity from both parties and it has stayed that way between J-Lo and the girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everyone Jennifer Lopez Dated, In Chronological Order</a></span></p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-deleted-all-ig-pictures-relating-to-alex-rodriguez><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jennifer Lopez Deleted All IG Pictures Relating To Alex Rodriguez</span></h2><p>Unsurprisingly, after their breakup, JLo deleted all traces of Alex on her Instagram and <a href=#>unfollowed him</a>. While this shows that the singer has indeed moved on from Alex, there is no indication that she has completely cut off contact with his kids. What we know, however, is that the singer is completely focused on her new relationship with Ben Affleck, her kids, and her career. In essence, JLo is living her best life and we love to see it!</p><h2 id=alex-has-not-stopped-showing-love-to-his-daughters><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Alex Has Not Stopped Showing Love To His Daughters</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Proud father of two, Alex always expresses how deeply in love he is with his lovely daughters on his Instagram page. He describes them as the best part of him and takes them out on dates regularly. He didn’t return the same energy JLo dished out by unfollowing him on Instagram and also deleting all of their shared pictures, he still follows her to this day. The former MLB star recently made headlines after joking about his relationship status following the breakup. He made this statement while serving as a broadcaster on the American League Division Series.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Close Is Ben Affleck With J-Lo’s Son, Maximilian David Muñiz?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqGWRobK5edGom6uhl6qyu3nDmqygoKSav7R50q2gpaRdna63sYyaZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2strW0jKOcp6aZm7Kzecuop56yXZ%2B5sHnAq6adZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./14-things-everyone-forgot-about-mila-kunis-and-macaulay-culkins-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>14 Things Everyone Forgot About Mila Kunis And Macaulay Culkin's Relationship</span></a>
