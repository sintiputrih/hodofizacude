Its production wrapped up back in 2018 and it was supposed to be distributed by 21st Century Fox. But then the studio was acquired by Disney, which promptly shelved the completed film.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>As revealed by Neal Harmon, CEO and co-founder of the film’s new distributor, Angel Studios, in a chat with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Examiner</a>, Disney not only refused to release Sound of Freedom, but also sat on it for a year while its producer tried to pry its rights from the studio.&nbsp;</p><p>“Initially made with [21st Century] Fox. After it was completed, Fox was acquired by Disney, who said, ‘We can’t release this film.’ Eduardo spent over a year before [Disney] released the rights to the film. At that time, he tried to take it to theaters, but just as they were, COVID hit, and another three years passed.”</p><h2 id=h-but-did-disney-really-make-a-mistake-in-dropping-sound-of-freedom data-injectable=false>But did Disney really make a mistake in dropping Sound of Freedom?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Jim-Caviezel-in-Sound-of-Freedom.jpg><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>While the Mouse House does make questionable choices, its decision to shelve Sound of Freedom was most probably prompted by controversies around the authenticity of its source as well as the film’s star, Jim Caviezel, concerning ways of choosing to promote the film on his press tour.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Sound of Freedom is set to tell the real-life story of former Special Agent Tim Ballard, who quit his job with Homeland Security and didn’t hesitate to risk his life to rescue children from human traffickers. But many investigative reports have put a glaring question mark on the claims made by Ballard and the credibility of his anti-trafficking organization Operation Underground Railroad, which has been accused of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">faking evidence and fabricating statistics of rescues</a>.</p><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Then there is the matter of Caviezel himself. On his press tour, the actor best-known for starring in Mel Gibson’s The Passion of The Christ has been promoting the film, Ballard’s organization, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the lurid conspiracy theory</a> that there are a group of “elites” out there trafficking and then killing children to obtain the chemical compound Adrenochrome from them. Caviezel’s interviews with noted alt-right figures including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Bannon</a> and Scott McKay hoist a number of concerning, QAnon-inflected red flags.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>If Sound of Freedom indeed ends up being the financial success it is expected and predicted to be, it might be the second victory Disney voluntarily lost while trying to avoid a potential PR nightmare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGabn6PAsbXRmpqyZZiarrfFjJ2grKaVrnqzscmemq1lmJbAbq3Lq5yanKlir7O71KCfrWWZo3pyfMxmmKGdkZl6sLKMoqusZZqqubp5k2amqZ2enruoew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gay-actors-who-played-straight-characters.html><span>←</span><span>10 Gay Actors Who Played Straight Characters</span></a>
