To get caught up, Doom Patrol is a crew of unlikely superheroes, each with a traumatic past and quirky abilities. The team doesn’t follow the path of traditional superheroes either; with a dark sense of humor and surreal stories. The absurdly unrealistic world in which the Doom Patrol resides has an authentic message of acceptance, finding identity, and the intricacies of the human condition. We're all hoping the relatable crew will continue to make viewers laugh themselves to tears right up to the very end. But that end is nigh, nevertheless. The final six episodes of Doom Patrol put everything on the line as our heroes gather in order to defeat Immortus, who stole their longevities, as well as the relentless zombie butts. The loss of their longevity causes them to age rapidly, putting a ticking clock on the action. Will they set aside their differences and unite to defeat the remaining villains, or will the world be doomed once and for all?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>Diane Guerrero</a> </strong>(Orange Is the New Black) stars as Kay Challis, a character with multiple personalities, each with its own unique superpowers. <strong>April Bowlby </strong>(Drop Dead Diva) plays Rita Farr or Elasti-Woman, <strong>Joivan Wade</strong> (The First Purge) portrays Victor Stone, also known as Cyborg, and <strong>Michelle Gomez</strong> (Green Wing) assumes the character of Madame Rouge. <strong><a href=#>Brendan Fraser</a> </strong>(The Whale) voices the character of Cliff Steele, also known as Robotman, with <strong>Riley Shanahan</strong> as the physical actor. <strong>Matt Bomer </strong>(The Normal Heart) voices Larry Trainor aka Negative Man, with <strong>Matthew Zuk</strong> handling the physical portrayal under the bandaged-up costume. The series was created and developed for television by <strong>Jeremy Carver</strong>, who is also an executive producer, and it’s based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name. Without further ado, here’s when and where to watch Season 4 Part 2, as well as the previous seasons, so you can binge everything before the series closes. But first, here's the official logline for the final episodes:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the series’ gripping final episodes, the Doom Patrol meet old friends and foes as they race to defeat Immortus and get back their longevities. Battling between saving the world and each other, the Doom Patrol are forced to face their deepest fears and decide if they are ready to let go of the past in order to take their future into their own hands... and away from the zombie butts.</p><h2 id=when-is-lsquo-doom-patrol-rsquo-season-4-part-2-coming-out-on-max>When Is ‘Doom Patrol’ Season 4 Part 2 Coming Out on Max?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/doom-patrol-season-4-diane-guerrero.jpg><p>Earlier in the year, on January 5, 2023, Season 4 abruptly halted midseason with many unanswered questions. However, these questions can finally be put to rest on October 12, 2023! The two-episode Part 2 premiere will be followed by weekly releases, as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Warner Bros. Discovery</a> media release reported. As with every other season of Doom Patrol, the final episodes of Season 4 will be available to stream for subscribers of Max. The streaming service generally releases new episodes at midnight ET, so that's when you can expect the premiere of Doom Patrol Season 4 Part 2 to arrive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Max</a></span></p><h2 id=when-is-the-finale-of-39-doom-patrol-39-season-4-releasing>When Is the Finale of 'Doom Patrol' Season 4 Releasing?</h2><p>Doom Patrol will come to a close with its twelfth and final episode of Season 4 on November 9, 2023.</p><h2 id=watch-the-trailer-for-lsquo-doom-patrol-the-final-episodes-39>Watch the Trailer for ‘Doom Patrol: The Final Episodes'</h2><p>The <a href=#>trailer for Doom Patrol's final episodes</a> starts with our heroes' normal versions laughing at the thought of being a part of the Doom Patrol and then cuts to the characters questioning if this is the end. In an apparent flashback, the trailer revisits images of the most notable villains, including Mr. Nobody, who can travel between dimensions; Ezekiel, the giant cockroach; and Ultimax, known as The Brain. After briefly reminiscing, the team appears to gather and build up to their final mission to save the world from evil and the horde of zombie butt monsters.
