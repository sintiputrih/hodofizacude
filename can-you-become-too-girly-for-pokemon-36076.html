I now appreciate them as deep RPG games, as well as a line of games that, more or less, hasn't changed over the last thirteen years and yet ably retains its popularity and, surprisingly, quality.</p><p>I also now can appreciate Pokemon's rise to power across the world, and eventual downfall, more than I used to. As I've said before, Pokemon is my favorite example of successfully exploiting a franchise for your own, capitalistic, gain.</p><p>Maybe mature wasn't the best word choice. Cynically, maybe?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHykrc1msKitXZeypLvMnmStp59itKq%2By7Jkn6eiYr2wt8SmpqdmY2t9eIKO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-elizabeth-children-in-order.html><span>←</span><span>Aside From Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth Has Three Other Children</span></a>
