The years “2004” and “2007” were also featured on the dress, which honored Hazel and Phinneaus and Henry’s birth years, respectively.</p><p>The My Best Friend’s Wedding star told Harper’s Bazaar in October 2018 that <a href=#>her children</a> didn’t “have a true sense” of their mother’s fame.</p><p>“When they were starting to figure it out, it was like, ‘You’re famous?’” she told the magazine at the time. “And I said, ‘I think a lot of people might have seen the movie that I’m in or might know who I am.’”</p><p>In October 2017, the Notting Hill star admitted to Harper’s Bazaar that she was a “selfish little brat” before meeting Moder, 53, and becoming a mother. “It was meeting Danny … finding my person,” she shared at the time. “When I think about what makes my life my life and makes sense and just shines inside of me … it’s him. Everything has come from that for me.”</p><p>She added: “I was my priority [before]. … There are great things I’ve accomplished and I’d be happy to accomplish more, of course, to impress my children and <a href=#>my husband</a>. But you know what? I’ve been spoiled already. If I wasn’t here today, I’d be in the carpool lane ferrying my kids to school.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source also shared exclusively with Us Weekly in May 2018 that Hazel, Phinnaeus and Henry were the Academy Award winner’s “top priority.”</p><p>“Julia just loves watching [Danny] with the kids,” the insider explained at the time, calling her a “hands-on parent” with a “simple [and] laid-back” life in Malibu. “It fills her heart and makes her love him even more.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2FCrbXAZqmompWnwbR506KapJ2kYsGwec%2BaqZqcmaiybrzRnqSinaKaeqW%2BxKyqZqCfo7yzv4yfmKahnK58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inspectah-deck-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Inspectah Deck Net Worth - Pulptastic</span></a>
