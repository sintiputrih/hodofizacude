Let’s take a look.</p><p>90 Day Fiance viewers first met Jovi and his Ukrainian-born wife, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yara Zaya</a>, during Season 8 of the flagship series.</p><p>The duo met on a traveling app while Jovi, a New Orleans native, was traveling overseas for his job.</p><p>Jovi’s job involves plenty of travel, as 90 Day Fiance viewers have witnessed, but what does it entail, and how much does he earn?</p><p>The TLC star currently works as an ROV (remote-operated vehicle) supervisor in the oil and gas industry. Previously, he held a position as an ROV pilot.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GlassDoor.com</a>, ROV supervisors in the New Orleans area earn an average base salary of $85,332, with some in the field earning as much as $109,000 annually.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-90-day-fiance-star-jovi-dufren-works-as-an-rov-supervisor>90 Day Fiance star Jovi Dufren works as an ROV supervisor</h2><p>Jovi explained a little bit about his job’s duties during an episode of 90 Day Fiance: “I work with underwater robotics. Basically, we send a machine underwater. It’s about the size of a car, and it can go down to 12,000 feet. And once it gets down there, I run all the controls for it.”</p><p>Among Jovi’s other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">work-related skills</a> are subsea engineering and offshore operations. Jovi’s line of work has proven to be lucrative and reliable, as he has worked in his position since April 2013.</p><p>According to multiple outlets, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his net worth</a> is $200,000.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jovi-capitalized-on-his-reality-tv-fame>Jovi capitalized on his reality TV fame</h2><p>In addition to his work in the oil and gas industry, Jovi – who is represented by Dominton Talent House based in Los Angeles – has capitalized on his reality TV fame and also pulls in cash as a social media influencer and on Cameo.</p><p>Jovi offers solo personalized videos on the platform, where he charges $55, or $300 for a business video, $165 for a live call, and $5 for a message. Jovi teamed up with his wife, Yara, on Cameo, where they offer personalized messages for $7.</p><p>As 90 Day Fiance viewers learned during the Happily Ever After? Season 7 Tell All, No Limits, Jovi and Yara share a bank account. Therefore, some of Jovi’s wealth is supplemented with Yara’s online boutique, YaraZaya.com, which he plugs on his Beacons website via his Instagram bio.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Jovi and Yara have come under fire for living a luxurious lifestyle, however, as some 90 Day Fiance viewers question how they afford it.</p><p>The couple often travels the world along with their 2-year-old daughter, Mylah. Yara isn’t shy about her love of all things bougie, either, including designer clothing and accessories and, recently, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a breast augmentation</a> in Los Angeles.</p><p>Yara came to her and Jovi’s defenses when a critic questioned how they afford <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their expensive lifestyle</a>.</p><p>“I work. I do for living what I love and I get pay,” she told her critics, adding, “Maybe because I work [sic], I work hard, and I spend whatever I want, right? I will not take this money to the grave, so that’s why I spend.”</p><p>Season 4 of 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way premieres on Sunday, January 29 at 8/7c on TLC and Discovery+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6edrrV5w6icrGWapMOqecOunaudnmKxsHnFqKlmmV2htre1zaBkoZ2imsButM6wZK2glWKGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjKyrmqpdmq6zutJmn6KrXaK8r7HYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosalia-red-carpet-photos-met-gala-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Rosala Is a Vixen in a Black Gown and Veil at the 2024 Met Gala</span></a>
