<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Tidelands Season 2 Netflix Release Date: When Will There Be Another Series</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>In Netflix’s quest to solidify its position as the world’s No. 1 streaming service against other ambitious services such as Hulu and HBO, the streaming giant is even more willing to become the one-stop-shop for all entertainment desires.&nbsp;It continues to invest in different types of shows, ranging from high-quality shows to center-of-the-park productions, with Netflix leaving no prisoners on the streaming battlefield.&nbsp;One of his latest productions is Tidelands, a series released on December 14, 2018, which received mixed reviews from critics.</span></p><p><span>When Netflix releases a new show, it dominates film and TV conversations based on its quality and acceptance by a wider audience.&nbsp;The show, which is Netflix’s effort to create a series aimed primarily at its Australian market, was produced by Netflix and Hoodlum Entertainment.&nbsp;The production of the Netflix-led show was on a mission to create a show that would stand out on Australian television and the writers were able to achieve this through elements such as nudity, crime and the supernatural.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tidelands-%e2%80%93-the-plot></span><strong><span>Tidelands – The plot</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Tidelands was created and written by Stephen M. Irwin and Leigh McGrath with Nathan Mayfield and Tracey Robertson also among the co-creators.&nbsp;For those wondering about the latest Netflix original series, the show tells the story of a small village, a coastal town in Orphan Bay.&nbsp;One of his daughters, Calliope McTeer, returns from prison after spending years in prison since the age of 10 for manslaughter and arson.&nbsp;Upon returning and discovering the body of a local fisherman, she realizes that the town is the habitat of the supernatural, dangerous half-mermaid, half-human creatures called Tidelanders.</span></p><p><span>Tidelands takes its place in the bandwagon of supernatural shows currently on TV, which are mostly stables of the CW network, but it goes a step further with the gritty nature of its evil and crime and of course, the nudity.&nbsp;Although Tidelands fails in executing some of its interesting storylines, such as reversing the normalized gender dynamic that male Tidelanders become attached to females because they possess far superior supernatural abilities, and the behavioral implications economic changes on human life, show offers an enjoyable story that entertains the viewer.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=season-and-episodes></span><strong><span>Season and episodes</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Currently, there is only one season of Tidelands with no word on a possible second season as of yet.&nbsp;Being a Netflix production, the chances of a second season happening depend on the statistics of the first season i.e. the viewing figures and ratings of the show.&nbsp;The show is currently enjoying mixed reviews among critics, with notable review sites like IMDb giving it a 7.1/10, while popular review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes ranks it at 80. %.&nbsp;Reviewers from The Guardian gave it two stars out of five, while The Review Geek felt it deserved a 4/10.&nbsp;At the moment, however, it enjoys an 85% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes.</span></p><p><span>Tidelands has eight episodes in its first season with an average running time of 47 minutes.&nbsp;Each episode is directed by Toa Fraser and written by Stephen M. Irwin.</span></p><p><span>The episode titles are: Home, Orphans of The Wait, Not One of You, Don’t Trust Humans, The Vocation, The Loyalty, The Prophecy, and The Queen’s Knife.</span></p><p><span>The show is available on Netflix for all users after its worldwide release on December 14, 2018.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cast-and-characters></span><strong><span>Cast and characters</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Tidelands features a relatively small group of Australian actors and actresses split into main and recurring cast.&nbsp;Much like opinion on the performance of the cast members, opinion on the plot and execution of the series is split among critics.&nbsp;Here’s a look at the series’ cast members.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=charlotte-best-%e2%80%93-calliope-%e2%80%98cal-mcteer></span><strong><span>Charlotte Best – Calliope ‘Cal’ McTeer</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Charlotte Best plays the title character who is primarily referred to on the show as Cal.&nbsp;His return to the village triggers the events of the show.&nbsp;After finding the body of a deceased fisherman, she begins an investigation that reveals the village’s sinister secrets.</span></p><p><span>Having played the role of Annie Campbell in&nbsp;</span><span>Home and Away</span><span>&nbsp;from 2007 to 2010, Tidelands marks a return to major global production for the Australian actress whose other roles include Cheryl Hayes.&nbsp;</span><span>Puberty Blues</span><span>, Kelly in&nbsp;</span><span>Soulmates</span><span>&nbsp;and as Kara Warrington&nbsp;</span><span>An American in Texas</span><span>.&nbsp;Her work has been mostly limited to the Australian industry and she has earned a Favorite New Female Talent nomination so far. She is likely to return for the show’s second season if it exists.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=elsa-pataky-%e2%80%93-adrielle-cuthbert></span><strong><span>Elsa Pataky – Adrielle Cuthbert</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Elsa Pataky is one of the most globally recognized faces on the show.&nbsp;Elsa, who played Elena Neves in the Fast and Furious franchise in Tidelands, stars as Adrielle Cuthbert, queen of the Tidelanders.&nbsp;As the story unfolds, she is exposed to a coup by a rival among the Tidelanders.&nbsp;Elsa Pataky, through her experience on projects like&nbsp;</span><span>Snakes on a Plane, 12 Strong, Give ’em Hell, Malone,</span><span>&nbsp;etc. brings a more mature performance to the role and improves the acting quality on the show.</span></p><p><span>She is also credited as the wife of Marvel superstar Chris Hemsworth, who plays the god of thunder, Thor.&nbsp;As to whether she will return for the show’s

for the second season of the series is not yet clear, but he is widely expected to return.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=marco-pigossi-%e2%80%93-dylan-seager></span><strong><span>Marco Pigossi – Dylan Seager</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Marco Pigossi is one of the non-Australian cast members on the show.&nbsp;He plays Dylan Seager, one of Adrielle’s lieutenants in Tidelander.&nbsp;Dylan is caught between the power faction that led to Adrielle’s downfall as queen and the injuries he suffered in the battle leave him in doubt about appearing in a potential second season of the show. .</span></p><p><span>The show is one of Marco Pigossi’s English roles.&nbsp;The Brazilian actor, actor since the age of 13, has starred in mainly Spanish productions.&nbsp;His background in theatre, film and television make him one of the most experienced actors on the show.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section

which began after graduating from the National Theater Drama School, led him to a worldwide project, Tidelands.&nbsp;In Tidelands, he plays Colton Raxter.&nbsp;Like the majority of the cast, he is not confirmed to return for the second season of the series but there is a good chance that he will appear in the second season if there is one.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section

id=tidelands-season-2-release-date-will-there-be-another-series></span><strong><span>Tidelands Season 2 Release Date: Will There Be Another Series?</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>So far, there has been no official word from Netflix regarding the release of a new season as mentioned earlier.&nbsp;The series was released on December 14, 2018, so it might be a bit early to determine the value of a second season.&nbsp;However, due to the popularity in Australia, where Netflix is ​​looking to cement its influence in the market, the reception has been good and might even be the deciding factor in granting the show a second season.</span></p><p><span>If a second season is approved by Netflix, the show is expected to continue from the end of the first season which saw Cal become the new queen of the Tidelanders after defeating Adrielle.</span></p><p class=postsid
