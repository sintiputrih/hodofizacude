It was her sixth win in seven fights.</span></p><p class=p1><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Murphy</a> was considered the underdog against Tate, who had moved down to flyweight after fighting as a bantamweight for most of her career. But just like she has for most of her career, she proved her doubters wrong by coming out on top.</span></p><p class=p1><span>It wouldn’t be a surprise if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Murphy</a> is once again tipped by many to lose to Andrade. After all, she will be in enemy territory in Rio, where the crowd will be completely against her.</span></p><p>Moreover, Andrade is a very dangerous fighter. She is a former UFC Strawweight champion who has a ton of experience in big fights. Moreover, all of her last five wins have ended in stoppage, and four of those five came in the first round.</p><p class=p1><span>But discount <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Murphy</a> at your own risk. The 39-year-old has spent her whole career defying people’s expectations. She is as tough as they come, and as she said after her win against Tate, no one is going to walk over her in the division, not even a tough fighter like Andrade.</span></p><p class=p1><span>Aside from Murphy herself, her merch, which you can find at Fan Arch, will also defy your expectations with their overall quality.
