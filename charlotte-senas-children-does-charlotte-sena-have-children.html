Shortly after her disappearance, Charlotte’s bicycle was found, leading authorities to conclude that she had been kidnapped; a scenario that state Governor Kathy Hochul called “everyone’s nightmare.”</p><p>According to the New York Times, after an intense 48-hour search, the 9-year-old Charlotte Sena who went missing over the weekend while camping with her family in upstate New York was found safe on Monday night. The suspect is in custody, according to the New York Times State Police.</p><p>At a press conference Monday night, Ms. Hochul identified the suspect as Craig Nelson Ross Jr., 47 years old. She said the case began to unravel before dawn on Monday morning, when state police were surveilling Charlotte’s family’s home in Greenfield, N.Y. nearby, noticed a car approaching and that someone possibly Mr. Ross had dropped a ransom note into the letterbox.</p><p>The governor said police recovered the note and were able to get fingerprints from it. That fingerprint was linked to Mr. Ross’s 1999 arrest for drunk driving.</p><p>Hours after the fingerprint comparison, law enforcement went to Mr. Ross’s mother’s house near Milton, N.Y., where he was living in a campsite behind the residence. Law enforcement searched the RV and arrested Mr. Ross, the governor said.</p><p>Officials then found Charlotte Sena hiding in a closet. Ms Hochul said Charlotte was in good health and had been taken to hospital for examination. She added there were no charges yet against Mr Ross, but charges were expected soon. In an earlier statement, state police said officers had determined the suspect “was in the Moreau Lake State Park area at the time of Charlotte’s disappearance.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Charlotte Sena’s children?</h2><p>Nine year old Charlotte Sena doesn’t have any child at the moment as she’s just a child enjoying her childhood and the love of her parents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpyfmqqcpMG1sYysnKeZo2KwqbXLnamepl2ZvKa%2FjJyfmqqcpMG1sYysnKeZXZ2ut7GMnJ%2BipJSnsq97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roswell-independent-school-district.html><span>←</span><span>Berrendo Middle School - Roswell</span></a>
