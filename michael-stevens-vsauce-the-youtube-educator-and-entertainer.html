Aside from being a YouTuber, he is known as an educator, comedian, speaker, entertainer, and editor. In addition to Vsauce, he is part owner of two other successful YouTube channels, Vsauce 2 and Vsauce3, with collaborators Kevin Lieber and Jake Roper.</p><p>Stevens’ net worth stands at an impressive $3.2 million, reflecting the success he has achieved since launching his career in the late 2000s.</p><h3>Early Pursuits and Rise to Prominence</h3><p>Stevens grew up in the small town of Stilwell alongside his sister, Melissa. His passion for knowledge and drama as a child later led him to pursue a degree in Psychology and English Literature at the University of Chicago. It was during his time there that he discovered his interest in video editing.</p><p>Although he joined YouTube in 2007, Stevens did not achieve recognition until 2010 when he moved to New York. It was during this period that he honed his video editing skills while working with Barely Political and Next New Networks.</p><p>Stevens also delved into acting, notably appearing as the Bearded Nun in a television comedy show alongside Todd Womack, Mark Douglas, Andrea Feczko, and Amber Lee Ettinger.</p><h3>YouTube Success and Influential Collaborations</h3><p>In 2010, Stevens launched his own YouTube channel, initially focusing on Video Game Culture as both producer and host. As his platform evolved, he transitioned to DOT, an educational series which significantly boosted his channel’s subscribers, encouraging him to expand into informational and educational content, including Science, Illusion, Philosophy, and cultural topics. Today, his main channel boasts over 12 million subscribers and has garnered over a billion views, contributing substantially to his net worth.</p><p>In addition to his main channel, Vsauce 2 and Vsauce 3, hosted by Kevin Lieber and Jake Roper respectively, specialize in video game culture and internet-related content.</p><p>Beyond YouTube, Stevens worked as a content strategist for Google in London, further bolstering his financial standing. He has also collaborated with acclaimed scientist Bill Nye on video productions, delivered TED talks, and made appearances at events such as YouTube Fun Fest in Toronto.</p><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Stevens is married to Marnie and resides in Los Angeles with Jake Roper, host of Vsauce 3.</p><p>﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Michael Stevens</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3.2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 23,1986</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>October 15, 2015, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Kansas City, Missouri USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Youtuber</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Chicago</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Marnie Stevens</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Melissa</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/tweetsauce?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/electricpants/?hl=en</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5955634/</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special, Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Writing, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Nonfiction Program, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special, Primetime Emmy A…</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>WGA Award for Best Comedy/Variety – Music, Awards, Tributes – Specials – Television, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy, Variety, or Music Special, Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay, DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Television Fi…</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Herblock – The Black & The White, Thurgood, Sin, Bad City Blues, All Together Now: A Celebration of Service, Christmas in Washington</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Turn Down for 2014</td><td>2014</td><td>Video short</td><td>Vsauce</td></tr><tr><td>Super Brainy Zombies</td><td>2014</td><td>Short</td><td>Michael</td></tr><tr><td>Asdfmovie6</td><td>2013</td><td>Short</td><td>Guy Talking About Carrots (voice)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>YouTubers React</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Nerdy Nummies</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>mental_floss: The List Show</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself – Host</td></tr><tr><td>America Declassified</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself – Science Journalist</td></tr><tr><td>Chris Hardwick’s All-Star Celebrity Bowling</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The Mythical Show</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Vlogbrothers</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The Flog</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself – Guest</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmikopuYlrKtedKtnK%2Bdnqh6t7%2FArpqeZaSdsm7Fzq6rrpqVYrKlwcKaq6iqXZa7pXnEp6ueqqSWtq%2Bx0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jill-dobson-net-worth-155867.html><span>←</span><span>Jill Dobson Net Worth</span></a>
