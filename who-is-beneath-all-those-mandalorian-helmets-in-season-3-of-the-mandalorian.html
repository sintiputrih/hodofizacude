Recommended Videos As the first episode was all too giddy to show us, we can expect quite a bit of screen time for a plethora of new and old Mandalorians. In the season three premiere, viewers were treated to a memorable scene featuring a sort of ritual for the Children of the Watch. These Mandalorians follow and enforce the old Mandalorian Creed, which involves never removing your helmet, and season three’s opening scene saw them welcoming a young boy as the newest member of their group."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In the season three premiere, viewers were treated to a memorable scene featuring a sort of ritual for the Children of the Watch. These Mandalorians follow and enforce the old Mandalorian Creed, which involves never removing your helmet, and season three’s opening scene saw them welcoming a young boy as the newest member of their group. The ceremony is interrupted by a gargantuan, crocodile-esque sea monster that manages to devour a few Mandalorian warriors before Din Djarin intervenes with a Starfighter, and kills the beast.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>Among the many colorful, covered faces in the crowd during that ceremony, only a few had names attached to them. Here are the ones we’ve been clued into so far.</p><h2 id=h-what-are-the-names-of-the-mandalorians-in-the-beach-scene data-injectable=false>What are the names of the Mandalorians in the beach scene?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/paz-vizsla.png><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Of the countless Mandalorians that went up against that sea monster, we only know the names of two (excluding Pedro Pascal’s Din): The Armorer, played by Emily Swallow (Supernatural) and Paz Vizsla (pictured above), played by Tait Fletcher (Breaking Bad).</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Most viewers likely easily recognize the Armorer’s name, as she’s been one of the most heavily-involved Mandalorians in protagonist Din Djarin’s escapades thus far. Plus, that golden, spike-laden helmet is distinct, and means the Armorer is only beat out, in terms of fan recognition, by the likes of Boba Fett, perhaps Bo-Katan Kryze, and of course Din Djarin himself.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Paz Vizsla, meanwhile, is a character we haven’t seen much of since his first appearance in episode three of the first season, barring his role in The Book of Boba Fett. Characterized by his bulky build and an enormous, gatling-like blaster, Paz is certainly one of the heaviest hitters among the Children of the Watch.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>Apart from these two, the slew of Mandalorians we saw in that early season three scene remain shrouded in mystery. Any names they bear remain unknown, and there doesn’t seem to be any information on who portrays them, either.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is the significance of so many Mandalorians?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-6.jpg><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>With this many Mandalorians around, there’s bound to be just as many opinions surrounding what makes a Mandalorian, and that just might be the spark this story needs to plunge itself into another round of Mandalorian civil wars.</p><p data-characters=635 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>We know Bo-Katan has a particularly colorful opinion regarding the Children of the Watch. As she looks to atone for her previous inability to unite her people — which culminated in the Night of a Thousand Tears — perhaps the source of such discord, namely the Mandalore tradition that decreed her unworthy of the Darksaber, will prove itself to be an active sore point. Indeed, the stage certainly appears to be set for a conflict between those who strictly adhere to the Way, and those who seek ideological freedom for Mandalorian warriors. And, as it turns out, you need lots of Mandalorians to engage in a Mandalorian civil war.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>It’s all just speculation for now, of course — we’ll just have to see what Favreau and co. have in store for us as season three progresses.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>The Mandalorian&nbsp;is available to stream on Disney Plus, with new episodes of the third season releasing every Wednesday until the season’s conclusion on April 19.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlkpq7pq3ToWSapJxiwam70p5kppmema6tu9GimKdlmJq5rrHTrGSipl2osqK%2FzqdkbGWfm3q1tMRmpJqmlJa5sL7ImqVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pryce-watkins.html><span>←</span><span>Pryce Watkins</span></a>
