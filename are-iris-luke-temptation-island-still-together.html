Luke got down on one knee and proposed to Iris — who said yes, per <a href=#>Yahoo</a>.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Screen Rant</a>, Iris shared her engagement in a now-deleted Instagram post saying, "I said YES to forever with my best friend. Relationships take hard work and I'm glad we choose to fight for each other everyday. I love you so much @luke_wechselberger." It seemed like Iris and Luke were one of the few success stories to come from the show, but not long after the season finale aired, rumors began to circulate that the couple had broken up.</p><p>Iris and Luke addressed these rumors in November 2022 and revealed that they were still together, per <a href=#>USA Network</a>. However, they did take a break over the summer of 2022 to get to know themselves better. Iris shared, "Things started feeling like they weren't quite right. We wanted to get to know ourselves individually and see what that was like, then maybe circle back after a few months to really figure out if we wanted to be together and make that lifelong commitment." Eventually, the two did find their way back to one another, or so people thought.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtjaYJ1gY6aqZ5lmae2tHnLrqKeZaSaurHAwK2gqKZdnsCtrc2dZKysmaG5bsDOoJytoJWnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-has-a-higher-net-worth-debra-jo-rupp-or-kurtwood-smith.html><span>←</span><span>Who Has A Higher Net Worth: Debra Jo Rupp Or Kurtwood Smith?</span></a>
