There was even talk of a straightforward remake a while back, but it would be safe to say the lore already has its bases pretty well covered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXWrBqXnEp6ursV2eu26tjJ%2BpmqaTnba0sYyypq5llJ6xr8CMnq2epl2gu7DDjKGYnWWjmr62scusZJuqlZbBqbHSZp2iqpVivK950q2pnpmdnruoew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sofyan-amrabat-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Sofyan Amrabat Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
