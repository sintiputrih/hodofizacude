In the interview, Lee reflects on her current run with IMPACT Wrestling and the diversity of the roster. Here are some highlights:</p><p>Lee: “In the three months that I have been a part of IMPACT Wrestling, everybody has seemed to just want to make it the best place possible for professional wrestling, and I can attest to the women all being women who support each other, and we all want to make it a better place and make it the best place for women’s wrestling. And so that’s the mentality I’ve noticed since day one, and I think because of that, and because everybody has that mentality, that IMPACT Wrestling is doing the things that it’s doing now, and it’s an awesome thing to see, and I couldn’t be more excited to be coming in at this time and to be a part of it long-term.”</p><p>Lee: “I think it’s the old me but improved. I’ve gone through my set of trials, tribulations, I’ve had some dark periods in my life that I’ve had to get through, and I’ve managed to get through them&nbsp; and overcome, and I think that defines you as a person, and it changes you as a wrestler, too, because that’s part of me, and I feel like people were starting to forget who I was, and I’m not okay with that. And so I came in wanting to remind people just exactly who I am and why I call myself the Crown Jewel and why I deserve to be at the top of the women’s division.”</p><p>Lee: “You know, it was awesome. Deonna and I have only ever wrestled one time before this, and it has been a few years at this point, so I was incredibly excited to share the ring with her again and on a much bigger platform this time. And you know, Deonna is somebody who she says it like it is. She is one of the greatest technical women’s wrestlers out there. I don’t know if I’d say she’s the best because I kind of think I’m pretty good too, but hey,. But she’s definitely somebody who is a force to be reckoned with, and I want to match myself with those people, and getting an opportunity to share the ring with her is a great one.”</p><p>Lee: “It’s just an amazing feeling to know that I’m a part of something that is so diverse, it gives women a lot of opportunities that a lot of places still don’t because, even now, with all the progress that we have made, there’s still this, like, feeling that the women have to go earlier on the card, and that’s not the case. And IMPACT lets us show that that’s not the case, and they give us the opportunities that we deserve.”</p><p>The full interview is available here:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZByb25pYWK4qrnBnqlmpJWaeqq5z5qarWWnp7K0wMuipaBllJ7Dpr7Soquy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jean-baptiste-kempf-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-292469-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jean-Baptiste Kempf Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograph</span></a>
