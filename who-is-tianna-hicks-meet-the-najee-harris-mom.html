She spent nights with homeless people along with her five other children.</p><p>She used to sleep in a van when she sent her children to her friend’s or relative’s house. But Najee was a momma’s boy; he would rather sleep with his mom in a car than to sleep alone without her.</p><p>But Tianna eventually graduated and got a medical assistant degree. She went to Phillip and Sala Burton Academy. Harris is one of the five children of Tianna.</p><p>When Harris moved to Alabama to pursue his career, Tianna wanted to follow his son but decided otherwise. She wanted him to give it his all.</p><p>Harris started playing football in his high school at Antioch High School in California. In 2014 as a Sophomore, the young American made the record of 2,263 yards run with 23 touchdowns.</p><p>She is currently living in Birmingham but might move in with her son soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=exploring-tianna-hicks-nationality></span>Exploring Tianna Hicks Nationality<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Nationality of Tianna Hicks has not been revealed, but Najee Harris holds American Nationality.

His perfect athletic body weight is 220lb.</p><p>Harris had a very difficult childhood while growing up. As a middle schooler, he also spent his night at the homeless shelter before his family moved to another city.</p><p>In the class of 2017, Najee was considered as the number one recruit by Scout and Rivals, while ESPN ranked him number 11 overall.
