Christina Aistrup Hansen, a former nurse from Denmark, was charged with attempted manslaughter and the murder of three patients at Nykobing Falster Hospital.</p><p>Hansen was sentenced to four murders and attempted murder after giving lethal doses of morphine and diazepam to her sick patients. She was also deprived of her authorization as a nurse. In 2017, nurse Christina Hansen was convicted of three murders and attempted manslaughter in four cases.</p><p>She had originally been sentenced to life imprisonment, but this was reduced to a 12-year prison term due to new evidence that suggested her medical abuse of patients did not occur accidentally during treatment.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Christina Aistrup Hansen, a skilled nurse with years of experience in the healthcare industry, was born on a beautiful day in 1984 in the wonderful country of Denmark. Although we do not have any information about her parents or family background, it is evident that Christina’s passion for nursing and helping others has been ingrained within her from an early age.</p><p>Growing up in Denmark, Christina must have witnessed firsthand how essential healthcare professionals are to society. It is no surprise that she pursued a career as a nurse and dedicated herself to providing top-notch care to patients. However, Hansen was arrested in 2016 for causing the death of three patients at a hospital in Denmark.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u5f1cfaaf438382d8828bd96745c7e771><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Betty Broderick Biography</span></a><h3>Christina Aistrup Hansen Career</h3><p>Nurse Hansen was convicted of attempted manslaughter in four cases instead of three murders due to a lack of direct evidence that her injections caused the patients’ deaths. She received a reduced sentence from life imprisonment to 12 years in prison.</p><p>In June 2016, the court in Nykøbing found Hansen guilty of three murders and attempted murder for deliberately administering lethal doses of morphine and diazepam to weak patients under her care. She was sentenced again for similar crimes later on.</p><p>Hansen, a nurse who was sentenced to prison and lost her authorization for administering deadly doses of insulin to patients, failed in her appeal for dismissal at the national level. The case serves as an example of the consequences healthcare professionals face when they violate their ethical duty to provide care.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Christina Aistrup Hansen Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Christina Aistrup Hansen</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1984</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>39 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Denmark</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Nurse&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 5” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 165 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 65 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 143 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her husband?</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>–</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ua6dab8ff361b0e1d1a0acb56681806fc><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Byron Yawn Biography</span></a><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Aistrup Hansen is a woman who has tied the knot and entered into the sacred bond of marriage.
