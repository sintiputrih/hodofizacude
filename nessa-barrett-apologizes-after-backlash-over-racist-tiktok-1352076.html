I know that it could have been taken offensively.”</p><p>She then apologized for any offense caused, saying “I just want to apologize for anyone who took it that way and was offended. I think… I’m sorry for anyone who practices that religion.”</p><p>Her apology did little to quell the criticism though. “Having a Muslim stepmom doesn’t justify what you did,” one comment read.</p><p>[ad name=”article2″]</p><p>Many also doubted that Barrett was unaware that it was from the Quran, as the original caption on the video read “I’m Muslim and I oop-.”</p><p>Barrett claimed in her Instagram Live that she had simply stumbled upon the audio while browsing the ‘For You’ page on TikTok, and thought it was “cute.”</p><p>Barrett’s boyfriend Josh Richards commented on the controversy in an Instagram Live, saying “I had no idea what it was either when I first saw the video, I didn’t know that was the Quran.”</p><p>[ad name=”article3″]</p><p>In response to people who said her first apology “wasn’t good enough”, Nessa released another TikTok to apologize further. “I am truly and deeply sorry to those who I have offended, I love people of all races, religions, shapes, and sizes.”</p><a title=@nessaabarrett href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@nessaabarrett</a><a title="♬ original sound - nessaabarrett" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound – nessaabarrett</a><p>She reiterated that she first saw the video of an “old man” and that if she had “known that it was something so sacred, I would never have used it.”</p><p>Barrett concluded by saying that the hate she was receiving was “really hard to handle, and it’s also coming at my friends and family, which is completely unacceptable, as it was my mistake, and not theirs.”</p><p>Barrett’s second apology video has racked up over 3.4 million views already, and attracted over 60,000 comments, some sympathetic, while others are still unforgiving.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbHXnqmtp16YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2imlajAonnBmqmrnaSpeqK8zqWmoKGqmsBurcWtnKtlkpawrLjArJ9mp6aav26%2BwJygrKxdqbaswM6kZGprZWd9eIKO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marry-my-husband-episode-11-release-date-and-time-confirmed.html><span>←</span><span>Marry My Husband episode 11 release date and time confirmed</span></a>
