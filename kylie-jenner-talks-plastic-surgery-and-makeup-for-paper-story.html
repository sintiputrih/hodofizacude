But in Paper magazine’s Transformation issue the new mom opened up about money, makeup and plastic surgery.</p><p>“People think I fully went under the knife and completely reconstructed my face, which is completely false,” she told the publication. “I’m terrified! I would never. They don’t understand what good hair and makeup and, like, fillers, can really do.”</p><p>She doesn’t deny that her lips are courtesy of fillers but she always had a lipstick obsession growing up. From the Lip Kit creator, this comes as no surprise. But how exactly did she transition her love of lippies into a multi-million dollar business? She followed her heart.&nbsp;“I just knew for myself as a customer, like, why am I buying a lip liner and a different lipstick?” She told the publication. “I wanted it the same color, I wanted it to be easy. And I really spent every last dime that I had starting it, not even knowing if it would be successful.”</p><p>Clearly following her gut paid off when in 2018, Forbes predicted Jenner would become the youngest billionaire with a net worth of $900 million. Even though she does consider herself self-made since none of her income comes from inheritance, she is aware that the Kardashian brand name helped build her business.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But it wasn’t just about money —which she claims she doesn’t even think about — her cosmetics empire is a way for her to promote something she truly believes in.&nbsp;“Makeup is something that makes me feel empowered, makes me feel good, and I think it’s such a positive thing,” she said. “There’s no harm in playing around with it and feeling good about yourself.”</p><p>She showed off that playful side in the shoot that accompanied the story. Wearing her hair in different bleach blonde styles, the 21-year-old rocked different ensembles ranging from a black and white pantsuit to a sporty leotard.
