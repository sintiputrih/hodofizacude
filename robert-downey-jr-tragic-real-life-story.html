With the 1992 biopic "Chaplin," in which he appeared in the title role of legendary film titan Charlie Chaplin, Downey received his first Oscar nomination; over the next few years, he turned up in well-received roles in several critically lauded projects, such as Robert Altman's "Short Cuts," Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers," and Norman Jewison's "Only You."
