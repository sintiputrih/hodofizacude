Still, according to <a href=#>ThoughtCo</a>, when it went to auction in 2014, its predicted going rate of over $100,000 took a humbling blow and it sold for just $28,400. It sold again a year and a half later for $20,655. If the trend holds, you'll be able to get Hitler's copy of Mein Kampf for free in time for the 2024 presidential election.</p><p>It's hard to say why someone would want a copy of Hitler's angry time journal. It was published in 1925, a full 13 years before the events of <a href=#>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>, so there's no chance that <a href=#>the dictator's</a> interaction with Doctor Henry Jones Jr. is mentioned. Maybe you're a completionist who fell into owning a copy of Mein Kampf's actual, real-life sequel, titled Zweites Buch, which seems like real wasted potential when you consider that he could have called in 2 Fast 2 Fuhrerous.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bj29ra3FfnbKzsdJmn6ivXaLCpLSMoaCtpJWnwG65xKKlZqORor2necisZKudkaG5unnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harshada-khanvilkar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-341896-html.html><span>←</span><span>Harshada Khanvilkar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
