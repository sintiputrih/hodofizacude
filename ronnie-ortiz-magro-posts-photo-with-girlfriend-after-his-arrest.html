Ortiz-Magro was not charged and was&nbsp;<a href=#>released the next day after posting a $100,000 bond</a>. The eyelash technician <a href=#>publicly stood by him</a> at the time.</p><p>“Ronnie and I are fine,” she wrote in an Instagram story following her boyfriend’s release. “There is a lot of misleading information floating around out there. With anybody who reached out with concern I appreciate it with all my heart, but everything that’s being portrayed out there are not facts. I don’t think it’s fair that people are using false accusations to gain attention.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ronnie-Ortiz-Magro-and-Girlfriend-Saffire-Matos-Post-First-Photo-Together-After-Domestic-Violence-Arrest-2.jpg><p>She concluded, “Please leave Ron and I alone. You don’t know what someone is going through at the end of the day. Don’t believe everything you hear or read online. I’d appreciate privacy please. Thanks for all your support.”</p><p>Ortiz-Magro, who is still under investigation for the misdemeanor, <a href=#>made a statement about the situation</a> after his release as well.</p><p>“I am grateful for all of my real friends,” he wrote via his Instagram Story at the time. “Being by myself the last few weeks — I take all experiences as lessons.”</p><p>He added, “You learn who really cares about you when your [sic] down and out and than [sic] you see who doesn’t! But I guess they call it the weeding process. Thank you to my real friends who haven’t left my side and haven’t betrayed me.”</p><p>Matos and Ortiz-Magro <a href=#>made their relationship Instagram official</a> in November 2020 and have continued to share glimpses of their romance on social media.</p><p>On Monday, Ortiz-Magro also posted a photo of his 3-year-old daughter, Ariana, whom he shares with ex <a href=#><strong>Jen Harley</strong></a>. The licensed realtor, 32, celebrated Mother’s Day with her little girl solo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ronnie-Ortiz-Magro-and-Girlfriend-Saffire-Matos-Post-First-Photo-Together-After-Domestic-Violence-Arrest-3.jpg><p>While Us Weekly confirmed the MTV star’s arrest did not involve Harley, the toddler was in Ortiz-Magro’s care when the alleged altercation occurred. According to a source, Harley was <a href=#>nervous about how her ex acted with their daughter</a> prior to his arrest.</p><p>“Jen has been concerned about his behavior in front of Ariana and it’s been an issue she’s been worried about,” an insider exclusively revealed in April. “She knows he always has this pattern and that he does not change.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us has reached out to Ortiz-Magro&nbsp;for comment.</p><p>If you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the <a href=#>National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp56jtqZ5zqurorJdoq6ovs5mp6irpKh6sbTOraZmr5mptW6zyKujn6qZmrulecCfq56qXZ22tHnAq6meq6Rk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-does-jay-monahan-make-per-year-in-2024.html><span>←</span><span>How much does Jay Monahan make per year in 2024?</span></a>
