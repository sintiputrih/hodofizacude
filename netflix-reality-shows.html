Elliot’s studio is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>currently based</a> in Hertford.</p><p>After graduating from the University of Bangor in Wales with a degree in Psychology, Elliot discovered his love of glassblowing. This quickly became his sole passion and pursuit in life.</p><p>Elliot developed his glassblowing skills at Stourbridge Glass Quarter. This town, based in the West Midlands, was the heart of glassmaking during the Industrial Revolution (1760-1840). The area of Stourbridge has been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>associated with glassblowing</a> for over 400 years, so it’s a pretty well-established place to learn the art!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=elliot-walker-on-blown-away>Elliot Walker on Blown Away</h3><p>Elliot’s Blown Away competitors were all impressed by his glasswork from episode 1.</p><p>Speaking of the difference between the British and American glass scene, Elliot said: “I’m intimidated going into a North American hot shop. The UK glass scene is very tight, very small. The level of skill and equipment you have in North America, we don’t have that [in the UK].”</p><p>But despite his nerves taking on North America, Elliot’s stateside competitors (and the judges) were all wowed by his glass creations.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=elliots-glass-creations-on-instagram>Elliot’s glass creations on Instagram</h3><p>If you are a fan of Elliot Walker’s on Blown Away, then you need to check out his Instagram. His profile is filled with beautiful glass art, as well as more on his creative process.</p><p>On the day of season 2’s release (January 22nd, 2021), Elliot already had established himself a large Instagram following of over 7,000. We’re sure this figure will only rise as he progresses throughout Blown Away.</p><p>You can follow Elliot Walker under the Instagram handle <span style=text-decoration:underline><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>@ewalkerglassart</a></span>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Elliot Walker (@ewalkerglassart)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p><strong>WATCH BLOWN AWAY SEASON 2 ON NETFLIX NOW</strong></p><p><strong><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> <strong>AND </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K1ssuir2aqlZa5qsDYZqqhp6eofKO4zrClZpmnlsZusculoKis</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kseniya-mikhaleva.html><span>←</span><span>Kseniya Mikhaleva - Age, Net Worth, Height, Bio, Career, Facts</span></a>
