Jirah Mayweather is the youngest of his children with Harris. In September 2010, Mayweather was sentenced to 90 days in prison after Harris claimed he beat her in front of their children. Harris says she suffered physical abuse from the boxer on "six occasions." Tragically aged 40, Harris accidentally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">died of a drug overdose</a> in March last year.</p><p>Since the death of her mother, Jirah has had a strained relationship with her father. Jirah <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a message </a>on Twitter implying that the boxer prioritized himself over his children. "Going from a parent who put ur happiness before theirs to a parent who puts their happiness before yours is probably one of the most frustrating thing ever," she tweeted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response to the message, Mayweather uploaded a picture of Jirah to his Instagram account but later deleted it. "Jirah, I will always love you unconditionally and always know that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. There is no limit to how far you can go in life! Always put God first and everything else will fall in place," Floyd Mayweather said in the deleted post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A month after her mother's untimely death, Jirah is took shots at her father, as well as, her siblings in a viral TikTok video. The teen was seen lip synching throughout the video to the song “According to You,” by Australian singer Orianthi. In the background of the video, she is seen smiling in a snap as she stands next to her dad. Yet the lyrics to the song contradict the family photo.</p><p>The lyrics include: “According to you/I’m stupid/I’m useless./I can’t do anything right.” The next picture shown is that of her brothers and sisters. She points to them as the lyrics play, “According to you/I’m difficult/Hard to please/Forever changing my mind.”</p><h2 id=mayweather-is-close-to-his-daughter-yaya-and-his-grandchild>Mayweather Is Close To His Daughter Yaya And His Grandchild</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mayweather seems to have a better relationship with his 21-year-old daughter Iyanna “Yaya” Mayweather.

In a video shared online, Mayweather has huge boxing gloves on his hands as he throws a couple of punches in the air, to show Kentrell Jr. how it’s done.</p><p>In an appearance on the radio show “Hollywood Unlocked,” Floyd spoke candidly about Yaya’s pregnancy. “Always want the best,” he said. “If that makes her happy, then we’re happy…me and her mother are happy.”</p><p>He was also asked about her relationship with NBA YoungBoy. “What I try not to do is be in her personal business because once she’s no longer under my roof, then you know what? it’s between her and her better half.” He continued on to say “As far as NBA… I look at NBA YoungBoy as a child. I can’t get upset with a kid like that. It could’ve been one of those days for him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Floyd Mayweather Made Almost $100K Without Lifting A Single Finger</a></span></p><h2 id=yaya-mayweather-faces-20-years-in-prison>Yaya Mayweather Faces 20 Years In Prison</h2><p>Back in April, Yaya was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested for aggravated assault</a> with a deadly weapon.
