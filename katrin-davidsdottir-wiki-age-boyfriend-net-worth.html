I started working more closely with my coach, Ben Bergeron, and he not only got me the fittest that I’ve ever been, but he got my mental game to a whole other level. And I think that’s the biggest thing. We can all work out and we’re all fit, but this year I’ve been working so much on my mental approach and just staying in that mental mind game, staying focused on yourself, and only the next task at hand.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/aussiecelebs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/katrin3-300x300.jpg><p>So far, in the last leg of CrossFit games, Katrin Davidsdottir has accumulated a total score of 226 and is currently in the sixth position.
