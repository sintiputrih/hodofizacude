"It was the first day and he came over to me and introduced himself," she said of their first meeting. The two immediately connected, despite Tupac not being the kind of guy she would normally roll with. "And in high school, Pac was a little funny looking. Definitely from looking at him, wasn't necessarily the type of cat that I would even like, deal with," Jada added.</p><p dir=ltr>But none of that seemed to matter, as the rapper went on to become one of her best friends. Even though the pair's bond was mostly platonic, in 2015, Jada told <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> that she once forced Tupac to kiss her — but it was a total disaster. "There was a time when I was like, 'Just kiss me! Let's just see how this goes,' and when I tell you it had to be the most disgusting kiss for us both," she said with a laugh. She explained that it must've not worked because a "higher power just did not want that."</p><p>This revelation has, of course, not stopped people from speculating that Tupac and Jada had something more than friendship, with Will Smith once admitting that he was jealous of the two's friendship. "He was the image of perfection, but she was with the Fresh Prince," Will told <a href=#>"The Breakfast Club"</a>&nbsp;in 2020. "I was deeply insecure and I wasn't man enough to handle that relationship."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWtibYNye9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2frqWtjKmgp6OVqcFuv8yiq6GrXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW7DyK2fZqylpa6kew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tanner-hoang-missing-texas-am-students-car-found-unattended-as-search-continues-520236-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tanner Hoang: Missing Texas A&amp;amp;M students car found unattended as search continues</span></a>
