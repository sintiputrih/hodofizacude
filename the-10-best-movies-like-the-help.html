On the other hand, Stone’s Skeeter is a young, white, aspiring journalist who is hellbent on bucking cultural norms. Skeeter’s audacious plan to record the maids’ stories gives voice to the voiceless and sheds light on the maids’ daily struggles with racism and injustice. The resulting book, supposedly authored by “the help,” causes a revolution in their sleepy hamlet, upending their lives and posing new challenges to the status quo.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Octavia Spencer’s Oscar for Best Supporting Actress is just one of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the many honors the picture garnered</a>. Fans of&nbsp;The Help&nbsp;will like this selection of 10 excellent films with fascinating plots exploring issues that push against societal standards, shed light on historical struggles, and impact the human spirit.</p><h2 id=h-10-the-butler-2013 data-injectable=false>10.&nbsp;The Butler&nbsp;(2013)</h2><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>The Butler, directed and co-produced by Lee Daniels and written by Danny Strong, is based on Wil Haygood’s piece “A Butler Well Served by This Election” from the Washington Post. Forest Whitaker plays Cecil Gaines, an African-American who served as a White House butler for 34 years and witnessed significant political and social events of the 20th century. The film is loosely based on the life of Eugene Allen, who worked in the White House for decades.</p><p data-characters=652 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Forest Whitaker gives a moving and understated portrayal of Cecil, a man who exemplifies modesty and discretion in a world rife with bigotry and abuse of power. Oprah Winfrey’s performance as Gaines’ larger-than-life wife, Gloria, is equally impressive.&nbsp;The Butler&nbsp;expertly juggles its two stories, which move back and forth between the White House and Gaines’ home life. This dynamic illustrates the contrast between the individual and the political, the served, and the server. Critics were generally positive, with some reservations about the film’s historical accuracy and its characterization of President Reagan.</p><h2 id=h-9-loving-2016 data-injectable=false>9.&nbsp;Loving&nbsp;(2016)</h2><p data-characters=670 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Based on the landmark Supreme Court decision of 1967,&nbsp;Loving&nbsp;tells the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple who fought to overturn Virginia’s anti-miscegenation laws. Based on the documentary&nbsp;The Loving Story&nbsp;(2011) by Nancy Buirski, about the Lovings and their landmark case, the film is a biographical love drama directed and written by Jeff Nichols. Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga bring genuine emotion to their Richard and Mildred Loving portrayals. Richard, played by Edgerton, is a stoic and devoted husband who struggles to make sense of the complex legal and political disputes he and his wife are pushed into.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=637 data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, Negga’s Mildred is a quiet force in their struggle for justice despite being a soft-spoken but stubborn woman. Their acting lends an air of quiet dignity and genuine feeling to this epic tale. The stillness of&nbsp;Loving&nbsp;and its emphasis on the Lovings as regular individuals rather than symbols of a movement are two of the film’s greatest strengths. The film was well-received critically and was called one of the finest of 2016 by several publications; it also got multiple award nominations, including Best Actor nods for both Edgerton and Negga at the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, respectively.</p><h2 id=h-8-the-color-purple-1985 data-injectable=false>8.&nbsp;The Color Purple&nbsp;(1985)</h2><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Based on Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1982 novel, Steven Spielberg and Menno Meyjes’&nbsp;The Color Purple is a 1985 American epic coming-of-age historical drama film. In addition to Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, the cast also includes Oprah Winfrey, making her film debut. Through unimaginable torture, hardship, and heartbreak, but finally, through resilience, liberation, and self-discovery,&nbsp;The Color Purple&nbsp;portrays the tale of Celie Harris’s life over forty years.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>The film opens with Celie as a girl in rural Georgia, where her father abuses her physically and sexually. After being sold into marriage to Danny Glover’s abusive “Mister,” her troubles only worsen. Celie’s bond with Sofia (Oprah Winfrey, unforgettable in her Oscar-nominated performance), a defiant woman unafraid to fight for her dignity, and Shug Avery (Margaret Avery, glamorous as the singer and Mister’s mistress), helps keep her spirit intact despite her hardships. The movie was well-received by audiences and critics alike.</p><h2 id=h-7-mudbound-2017 data-injectable=false>7.&nbsp;Mudbound&nbsp;(2017)</h2><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>The post-war Mississippi Delta is the setting for&nbsp;Mudbound, an impressive examination of race and social conflicts directed by Dee Rees. Based on Hillary Jordan’s novel of the same name, the film is a sprawling narrative that reveals the intricate complexities of two families intertwined by land, ambition, and tragedy. It stars Carey Mulligan, Garrett Hedlund, Jason Clarke, Jason Mitchell, Jonathan Banks, Rob Morgan, and Mary J. Blige.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>The film’s central characters are white farmers, the McAllans, and their African-American farm workers, the Jacksons. Through the eyes of two World War II veterans, Jamie McAllan (Garrett Hedlund) and Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell), Mudbound delves into the nuances of the racial divide in the Jim Crow South. Returning to civilian life in Mississippi after serving together highlights the state’s severe racial inequities, despite their shared experiences in combat.</p><h2 id=h-6-driving-miss-daisy-1989 data-injectable=false>6.&nbsp;Driving Miss Daisy&nbsp;(1989)</h2><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>In the touching drama&nbsp;Driving Miss Daisy, Bruce Beresford examines an unexpected friendship against the backdrop of the American South at a moment of societal transition. The film, adapted from Alfred Uhry’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, is lauded for its comments on race and aging and the performances of Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy. Old Jewish Atlanta widow Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy) and her chauffeur Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman), are at the core of this drama.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>After Daisy crashes her car and her son hires Hoke to fix it, the two first distrust one another and are hostile against one another. However, over 25 years, their relationship transforms into an unlikely friendship that transcends racial and social standards. Tandy wins the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Miss Daisy. She exemplifies Daisy’s transformation from an arrogant, irritated lady into someone who loves and cares for Hoke. Even more captivating is Freeman, who reprises his character from the play.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-5-12-years-a-slave-2013 data-injectable=false>5.&nbsp;12 Years a Slave&nbsp;(2013)</h2><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Numerous critics and media sources agreed that&nbsp;12 Years a Slave&nbsp;was the best film of 2013. Based on the 1853 memoir of the same name by Solomon Northup, a free African American from New York State kidnapped in Washington, D.C., in 1841 and sold into slavery, the film was directed by Steve McQueen and written by John Ridley. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup, while Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong’o, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, and Brad Pitt are among the supporting cast.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>The plot follows Solomon, an accomplished violinist and a family man living in Saratoga Springs, New York, lured to Washington, D.C., with the promise of a job. Instead, he’s drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery in the South. Despite his attempts to reveal his free status, he’s forced to hide his literacy and endure the brutal conditions of slavery for twelve long years. Lupita Nyong’o plays Patsey, a fellow enslaved person who suffers alongside Solomon and is the object of their master Edwin Epps’s (Michael Fassbender) cruel obsession.</p><h2 id=h-4-selma-2014 data-injectable=false>4.&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;(2014)</h2><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Ava DuVernay and Paul Webb helmed and wrote the screenplay for the 2014 film&nbsp;Selma.&nbsp;David Oyelowo plays MLK Jr., and the film also has Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B.

Following a sequence of events, including the killing of civil rights activist Jimmie Lee Jackson by an Alabama state policeman, Martin Luther King Jr. and his group marched from Selma to Montgomery. The film depicts the political and strategic deliberation inside the civil rights movement, including King’s conversations with President Johnson and the debates within the movement over the best course of action.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-3-to-kill-a-mockingbird-1962 data-injectable=false>3.&nbsp;To Kill a Mockingbird&nbsp;(1962)</h2><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>To Kill a Mockingbird, starring Gregory Peck and directed by Robert Mulligan is a legal drama film that has become an American classic.
