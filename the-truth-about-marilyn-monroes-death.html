With her curvy figure and pretty face, Conover recognized her potential. In January 1945, Monroe quit her factory job and began modeling as a pin-up girl for Conover. That August, she signed a contract with Blue Book Model Agency.&nbsp;By the time Doughtery returned in 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers, <a href=#>per Vintage News.</a> He disapproved of her career, and they divorced that September.
