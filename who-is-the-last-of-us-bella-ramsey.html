Many are familiar with actor <a href=#>Pedro Pascal</a> who plays leading man Joel Miller, but many are unfamiliar with actor Bella Ramsey who plays Ellie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who is this young performer and what has she starred in? Here's everything we know about Bella Ramsey.</p><h2 id=her-background><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Her Background</span></h2><p>Ramsey was born in Nottingham England in 2003, but this teenage actor has already starred in an impressive lineup of iconic television shows. She first became interested in acting when she was four years old and went to school to hone her hobby into a serious craft. And Ramsey isn't the only one with an artistic talent in the family, as her father is skilled with a trumpet and her sister participates in comedy theater - though they stay out of the limelight for the most part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bella-ramsey-is-non-binary><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Bella Ramsey Is Non-Binary</span></h2><p>This year, under massive attention due to her role in The Last of Us, Ramsey wanted her fans to know more about her after it was brought up that she was once nominated in the non-gender specific Best Young Performer category at the Critics Choice Awards for her role in a film called Catherine Called Birdy. She was very open about how she sees her gender as fluid and doesn't care about pronouns, making her<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> non-binary</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> 10 Stars Who Have Come Out As Non-Binary</a></span></p><h2 id=bella-ramsay-is-neurodivergent><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Bella Ramsay Is Neurodivergent</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While filming her newest project, The Last of Us, Ramsey made many self-discoveries, including being neurodivergent. Being neuodivergent is when one experiences mental or neurological functions that many consider to be outside the norm. Ramsey had always questioned the possibility but had finally undergone a diagnosis to confirm it and found a safe and welcoming environment on The Last of Us during the process.</p><h2 id=her-role-on-game-of-thrones><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Her Role On Game Of Thrones</span></h2><p>If Ramsey looks familiar, most fans would identify her with her breakthrough role on the HBO show Game of Thrones, where she played the spitfire Lyanna Mormont - the ten-year-old leader of House Mormont. She had a small, but memorable role on the show from 2016 to 2019 over the course of a few episodes, starting her journey on the show at just age thirteen! While she has a hard time watching herself on the show, she ended up becoming an instant fan favorite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These 10 Actors Got Their Big Break After Starring On Game of Thrones</a></span></p><h2 id=her-career><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Her Career</span></h2><p>Even though she's only nineteen years old, Ramsey has already built up a pretty impressive resume. After gaining recognition and momentum from Game of Thrones, Ramsey went on to star in a television adaptation of the book series behind The Worst Witch - though she dropped out of the series and was recast in the final season due to mental health struggles. She lent her voice to the children's animated show Hilda, where she also got to show off her singing chops, and will be concluding with a final, third season. Other major projects she's been a part of have been the comedy film Catherine Called Birdy, His Dark Materials, and Becoming Elizabeth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's Next For The Cast Of HBO's His Dark Materials?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-role-of-ellie><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Role of Ellie</span></h2><p>After starring in one of television's biggest shows with Game of Thrones, Ramsey wanted to lie low for a while and was unsure if she should take part in The Last of Us, as it is based on one of the most acclaimed and popular video game series to have ever been released. Ramsey grappled with the idea of fame and whether she wanted any part of such scrutiny and attention. However, after over a hundred young actresses were considered, including fellow Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams, Ramsey beat out all the competition, and they believed she was the perfect Ellie - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">regardless of any criticism from the video game community</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bonding-with-her-co-star><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Bonding With Her Co-Star</span></h2><p>While Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal both starred in Game of Thrones, they never interacted with each other because they appeared on different seasons. Ramsey has even joked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she hasn't seen Pascal's demise on the show</a> because she didn't watch much of the early seasons. However, The Last of Us has brought these two actors together closer than they may have ever imagined. Their friendship and love for each other blossomed, taking care of each other on the show similar to how their characters interact in the games. Their natural chemistry is a delight to watch on both the show and in many of their hilarious interviews. They both claim their newfound relationship fostered an immediate bond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-future-work><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Her Future Work</span></h2><p>After starring in both Game of Thrones and The Last of Us, there's no doubt that Ramsey will start being offered a plethora of roles in the near future. Already, she's working on voicing a character in the upcoming 2023 release of the <a href=#>sequel to the animated film Chicken Run</a> - Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget. While little else has been announced, it will not be shocking to see future seasons for The Last of Us or any future projects that utilize both Ramsey's knack for voice work and her singing ability that's been on display in a few of her previous roles. Whatever is in store for this young performer, we can't wait to see what she does next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMeeZKWZo6l6sLKMrqpmmpWhuaJ50ZqkrJ2pZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./troy-merritt.html><span>←</span><span>Troy Merritt -Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
