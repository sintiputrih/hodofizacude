The 6-star Psychube is my main pick as it will empower her kit while also increasing her survivability by increasing her overall DMG by 12% (at level 60) and allowing her to self-heal after defeating enemies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-Best-Psychube-for-Dikke-in-Reverse-1999.jpg><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true><strong>Using Brave New World can also work wonders if you plan on focusing solely on improving her damage.</strong> Brave New World will offer Dikke an 18% increase in Ultimate Might, as well as a 20 to 40% increase in Incantation Might to any attack she performs following her Ultimate, Maverick Judge.</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=73 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Reverse 1999 Tier List: All Characters Ranked From Best to Worst</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Best 5-Star Psychubes for Dikke</h3><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false><strong>The best 5-star Psychubes for Dikke are either The Footloose</strong> <strong>or Laughter and Laughter</strong>. The latter of which is my main pick for those looking to enhance her healing above all else.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>The Footloose will enhance her Ultimate Might by 15% at level 60 as well as increase her damage when attacking targets with 50%+ HP by 8-16% depending on its Amplification level. Laughter and Laughter will double down on survivability by decreasing the damage received by Dikke by 10% (at level 60) and buffing her healing by 3% after each turn passed (maximum of 4/8 stacks).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-5-Star-Psychubes-for-Dikke-Reverse-1999.jpg><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Reverse 1999 Chapter 4 Answers: Projector Relay, Power Source, and Crystal Orb</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Reverse:-1999-Best-Dikke-Team-Compositions data-injectable=false>Reverse: 1999 Best Dikke Team Compositions</h2><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=762 data-injectable=true><strong>The best Dikke team composition in Reverse: 1999 will feature her as a healer/sub-DPS, and either <a href=#>Bkornblume</a>, Baby blue (only on a team featuring a Mental DPS) or <a href=#>An-an Lee</a> as its main support. On the DPS front, Centurion, Eternity, Lilya, and <a href=#>Regulus </a>are my main picks</strong>. For the fourth slot in all teams featuring Dikke, I recommend the use of another debuffer or main DPS.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=The-Best-F2P-Team-Compositions-for-Dikke data-injectable=false>The Best F2P Team Compositions for Dikke</h3><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false><strong>The Best F2P Dikke composition will feature her as its main healer/sub-DPS, either Regulus, Eternity, or Lylia as its main DPS, and either Matilda or Twins Sleep as its main debuffer. </strong>Using Erik as a debuffer can also work.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>When using Regulus, don’t forget to attack with her in alternating turns so that you can make full use of her Critical-oriented Restless Heart Insight I passive. If you are using Eternity as your main DPS, Dikke will need to double down as a dedicated healer, so make sure you have a few copies of Justice in your hand at all times to keep your DPS alive and out of danger.</p><p data-characters=54 data-current-count=54 data-injectable=false>This guide was made while playing Reverse: 1999 on PC.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
