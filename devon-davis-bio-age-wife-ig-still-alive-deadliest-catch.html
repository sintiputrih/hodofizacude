The fishermen then hear a sudden blow, in which Devon suffers the consequences. So despite the onboard captain Rip Carlton warning the newcomer “Devon, it’s your first time on the boat, don’t get hurt”, Devon gets badly hurt.</p><p>And with one man down, everyone on the boat tried their best to revive the unconscious fallen Devon.</p><p>As per Yahoo! Entertainment’s reports Davis was last recorded pulling on a chain and then can be seen collapsing on the deck. And as the rest of the crew tried to revive him, viewers could hear via the radio that the fisherman had been struck in the head. That was the reason he had blood coming out of his mouth.</p><p>The crew was extremely worried for Devon also because one of them suffered the death last year in the same boat.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Deadliest Catch‘s Devon Davis Still Alive?</strong></h3><p>Fortunately, Deadliest Catch‘s Devon Davis is still alive.

And this is as per ZipRecruiter’s calculation.</p><p>Likewise, there should be a Deadliest Catch salary per episode as well that he is paid for being seen on the show.</p><p>For instance: Captain Sig Hansen, one of the most popular faces on Deadliest Catch is reportedly paid an average annual salary that is ranging between $500,000 and $1,000,000.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Devon Davis Age</strong></h3><p>Devon Davis was born in 1991.
