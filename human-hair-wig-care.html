"Wigs that have been chemically altered through bleaching and perming to create a curl pattern tend to fall apart faster. Higher quality and better cared for wigs can last for two to four years."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that that's settled, let's get into wig care.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-often-should-i-wash-my-wig></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Often Should I Wash My Wig?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since your wig is, well, a wig and not your natural hair, you don't need to follow the same wash day schedule. Instead, the frequency should be based on how often you wear the piece.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's best to shampoo and condition your human hair wigs at least every eight to 10 wears," the stylist explains. "The shampoos can be spaced out longer if you don't apply a lot of oil, gel, or hairspray while styling the wig."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-should-i-store-my-wig></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Should I Store My Wig?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You're going to need to go to the beauty supply store to pick up a mannequin head to maintain the shape of the wig. And no, there's no getting around this one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are many different types of mannequin heads that you can get for your at home hair collection," says Everett. "A more budget-friendly option is a styrofoam head. I don't recommend storing the wigs in plastic bags to avoid humidity, which leads to moisture building in the bag."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So yeah, step away from those bags you've got stored under the kitchen sink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Make Your Own Wig</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-there-a-specific-type-of-human-hair-that-tends-to-last-longer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is There a Specific Type of Human Hair That Tends to Last Longer?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No. According to Everett, all human hair wigs can be prone to damage if not properly taken care of, regardless of style or texture.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-there-any-way-to-revive-a-wig-thats-not-looking-so-good></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is There Any Way to Revive a Wig That's Not Looking So Good?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is why you've always got to have a good deep conditioner on deck.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Everett recommends <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Obliphica's Seaberry Mask</a> or <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Essations' Naked Honey & Almond Moisture Whip Conditioner</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$38; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>amazon.com</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$17; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I saturate the freshly shampooed wig with the conditioner, place it into a plastic bag, and steam it inside of a hot towel for at least 20 minutes," the stylist explains. "After the wig is softened and moisturized, I detangle from the ends up to the roots. Then rinse the hair until the water runs clear. Mold the wig hair in the direction you want it to dry and place it under a hood dryer."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-will-i-know-when-its-actually-time-to-call-it-quits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Will I Know When It's Actually Time to Call It Quits?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Trust us, you'll know. 'Cause things will start to look (and feel) real raggedy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You will know that the wig needs to be replaced or repaired when the hair feels stiff even after shampooing and conditioning," says Everett. "If the hair burns when you curl it or it doesn't hold a curl it's time to let it go. If the ends of the hair have split and they stay frizzy, it may be time to let that wig go."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also if you have a curly or kinky wig, and frizz has started to take over, it's time to part ways with it.
