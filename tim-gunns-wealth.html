He has made a reputation as a notable television personality, fashion consultant, actor, and mentor to designers on the reality show, Project Runway. Additionally, he holds the position of chief creative officer at fashion designer Liz Claiborne.</p><p>Ever wondered about the financial fortune of Tim Gunn? Reports estimate his net worth at $15 million, accumulated through his notable involvement in the fashion industry. Furthermore, his skills as an actor have also contributed to his net worth. His appearances in TV series and films including “How I Met Your Mother” and “The Smurfs” have further bolstered his wealth.</p><h3>Tim Gunn’s Net Worth: $15 Million</h3><p>Tim’s father, George William Gunn, served as an FBI agent during J. Edgar Hoover’s reign, and his mother Nancy was a housewife. During high school, Tim excelled as a swimmer. He later pursued a BFA in Sculpture from the Corcoran College of Art and Design.</p><p>His professional journey began in 1982 when he joined the Parsons New School Of Design. After a few years, he was appointed as the associate dean. His subsequent promotion to the position of Chairman in 2000 significantly boosted his net worth. In 2007, he took the role of chief creative officer at Liz Claiborne, further contributing to his wealth.</p><p>Regarding his TV career, he gained recognition in 2004 as he mentored designers on “Project Runway”. His presence on the show garnered immense popularity, and he remained a part of it for all 14 seasons. Thanks to his work on “Project Runway”, Tim received the Primetime Emmy Award in 2013 for Outstanding Host For A Reality Or Reality Competition Program.</p><p>Tim also ventured into various TV and film roles, including appearances in “Ugly Betty” as a Fashion TV Reporter and “How I Met Your Mother” as Barney`s personal tailor in 2010. His role as Henri in the film “The Smurfs” and Supervisor J-3 in the film “Teen Spirit” in 2011 further contributed to his flourishing net worth.</p><p>In 2012, his revenue streams saw a surge when he voiced the character Baileywick in the animated film “Sofia The First: Once Upon A Princess”, which later transitioned into the animated TV series “Sofia The First”. Furthermore, Tim is also an accomplished author. His co-authored book “A Guide to Quality, Taste and Style” was published in 2007, followed by the release of “The Natty Professor: A Master Class on Mentoring, Motivating, and Making It Work!” in 2015, which added substantially to his net worth.</p><p>On the personal front, Tim’s journey has seen challenges, including a suicide attempt at 17 due to his suppressed homosexuality, raised in a homophobic family. He came out to his sister at the age of 29, and despite being in a relationship during the 1980s, he has not been romantically involved with anyone else since. He currently resides in Manhattan.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tim Gunn</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 29, 1953</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Washington, D.C., United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>TV Personality, Consultant, Television producer, Actor, Screenwriter, Author, Film director, Voice Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Corcoran School of the Arts and Design</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Nancy Gunn, George William Gunn</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Timothy M.
