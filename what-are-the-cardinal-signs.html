Cardinal signs match up with the changing seasons: when the Sun enters Aries, spring begins, Cancer season indicates the beginning of summer, Libra season is the start of fall, and Capricorn season is the start of winter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do the cardinal signs have in common?</h2><p>Like everything in astrology, each Sun sign is different.

Often, cardinal signs are the strategists who organize group hangs and push things forward.</p><p>Additionally, cardinal signs are said to be initiators in relationships, always looking forward to taking the next step. They're career-oriented people who everyone wants on their group or team because of their motivational skills and ability to make things happen. Finally, cardinal signs are known for having great endurance and building on what already exists to get them where they need to go — in a career, in a romantic relationship, or otherwise!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyaqZ5lpJ2ybq%2FAq5uippGherS1xqeq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./you-aint-ready-chris-pratt-tries-to-drum-up-excitement-for-the-return-of-a-tv-series-roundly-trashed-by-critics.html><span>←</span><span>You aint ready: Chris Pratt tries to drum up excitement for the return of a TV series round</span></a>
