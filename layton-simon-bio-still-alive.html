Wiki Details</strong></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Layton Simon is an experienced and veteran drug dealer and a gangster from Detroit best recognized as one of the rivals of the Flenory brothers, Big Meech and Southwest T.&nbsp;</span><span style=font-size:12pt>However, Layton Simon doesn’t have a Wikipedia page yet.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Furthermore, Layton was born to his parents in Detroit, Michigan, United States. However, he has never revealed any information about his personal matters. Hence, he kept all the details of his parents, including their names, ages, and professions, secret from the media for their safety and privacy. Similarly, he never mentioned his siblings, so he has a high chance of being the sole child of his parents.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Moreover, Layton Simon also didn’t reveal his birthday and zodiac sign. Hence, his exact age and birth details cannot be determined. It is known that Layton is American and comes from Black ethnicity. Also, for his religion, he follows Christianity.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Regarding his physical appearance, Layton stands tall at the height of around 5 feet 8 inches/1.72 m and has decent weight for his body.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Concerning his education details, as he was into smuggling at 14, there is less chance that he ever graduated a high school.</span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong><span style=font-size:18pt>Is Layton Still Alive?</span></strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Layton Simon gained more fame and attention from the public after the Starz series BMF portrayed Lamar's character as inspired by his story. Layton shared his life story in an interview with the Original Gangsters Podcast and talked about how he loved playing basketball in Detroit.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Layton elaborated on meeting a man named Dirty Diamond while traveling to a game in the 1970s. After inquiring about the man’s 20-carat ring, the named Harold Stinson popped up. Since then, Layton discovered drug dealings since Harold Stinson was one of the large drug dealers before the Flenory brothers, Big Meech and Southwest T.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Layton began his drug-dealing practice when he was 14 years old after being enticed by Harold’s illegal business. Similarly, Layton was able to buy a new 1973 Cadillac by the age of 15. Ultimately, he took over some streets of Southwest Detroit and became rivals with Big Meech and Southwest T.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>When the police came into the action, Layton flew from the block, leaving all his territory behind for his rivals, The Flenory brothers.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Besides, Layton Simon has been getting attention for being the inspiration for the popular Starz series BMF character named Lamar. However, the real present status of Layton Simon cannot be determined since he has remained lowkey for several years.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Although it was not <a ondragstart=return!1 href=# rel=noopener>confirmed</a> by the official sources how Lamar was based on the story of Layton, people pointed out how Lamar also had mental illness and was taken with a psychiatric condition. Since Layton was also taken to a psychiatric ward in the 1980s, so many assume Lamar’s character to be inspired by Layton Simon.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunDA0Z6lnaGenHytrditpqdlo566sLqMm6CoZaOptq24jJqjoq6V</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-reveals-insane-christmas-decorations-inside-her-happy-place.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian reveals insane Christmas decorations inside her happy place</span></a>
