Answering “A” or “B,” the houseguests were asked seven questions about what they saw on the pages. By the end of the seventh question, Jag and Bowie Jane tied for first and moved into a sudden-death round. The allies were asked to calculate the number of seconds a certain competition from earlier in the season lasted. And without going over, the houseguest closest to the right answer won.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Well, as history has it, Bowie Jane won her third tie-breaker of the season and was handed the Head of Household key. The 46-year-old DJ and barrister has moved into the private suite three times since the beginning of week 10, and her most recent triumph guaranteed her a one-in-three shot at winning Big Brother 25. She also tied Cameron Hardin’s record for the highest number of Head of Household reigns this season.</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=150 data-injectable=false>There are only three episodes remaining this season, and the final four will shrink to the final three during a special live eviction on Sunday night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrqimXZ2yorCMqJ1moJ%2BqwKa0zqWbZqyYnsBuw8SeomannmKvqrOMm6morJiav25%2BlGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amazon-kindle-fire-review.html><span>←</span><span>The Operating System - Amazon Kindle Fire Review</span></a>
