(I will accept R&R as source material for <i>Joel Denver’s Future Hits</i>, but when it comes to AT40, only Billboard will do.)

REO Speedwagon, “Here With Me”</strong><br>My earliest American Top 40 memories come from REO Speedwagon’s 1981 “Keep on Loving You”/“Take It on the Run”/“In Your Letter” streak. The music was the music — everything sounds enticing when you’re 10 — but the warm, welcoming voice of Casey Kasem pulled me in further. He brought pep and passion to the proceedings. He gave out just enough information about Loverboy and Kenny Rogers to make you decent lunch-table company. He made you care what was going to be No. 1, even during those endless nine weeks when we all knew it was going to be “Bette Davis Eyes.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-14-0-0@published data-word-count=62>1981 was a very adult-contemporary time to become a young pop-music fan — Champaign’s “How ’Bout Us,” Marty Balin’s “Hearts,” and Franke and the Knockouts’ “Sweetheart” were aimed right at the 30-something divorcee market — but Casey’s enthusiasm made these songs seem like they had something to tell us. If Dick Clark was America’s oldest teenager, Casey Kasem was its favorite teacher.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-15-0-0@published data-word-count=48><strong>34.

Michael Jackson<a href=#>, “Another Part of Me”</a></strong><br>Listening to American Top 40, one could never tell which songs Casey Kasem liked, and, more importantly, one could never sense which ones he didn’t. From Michael Jackson to Rockwell, from “Do They Know It’s Christmas” to “I Wanna Be a Cowboy,” if there were any songs in the chart Casey felt were beneath him, he never let on. If it was in the Top 40, that meant you liked it, and if you liked it, it was important enough to be taken seriously. Let the rest of the world sneer at your taste in music; Casey Kasem treated you with respect.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-19-0-0@published data-word-count=36>Meanwhile, this video exists to inform you that in 1988, Michael Jackson enjoyed worldwide popularity.

Pebbles, <a href=#>“Mercedes Boy”</a></strong><br>Casey Kasem was never cool, and that’s why Casey Kasem was the coolest guy in the history of radio. One cannot imagine Casey calling Debbie Gibson his “good friend,” the way a Ryan Seacrest will a Demi Lovato. One cannot picture Casey Kasem buddying up to Bruce Springsteen or the Pet Shop Boys or Ronnie Milsap. He wasn’t flashy. Until Jean Kasem turned up on Cheers, we didn’t even know he had a wife. That’s because Casey Kasem did a thing that’s inconceivable in our compulsively oversharing world: He avoided the use of the word “I.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-24-0-0@published data-word-count=19><strong>27.

Huey Lewis & the News, <a href=#>“Perfect World”</a></strong><br>Fun fact: The guy who wrote this song, Alex Call, also wrote Tommy Tutone’s “867-5309 (Jenny).” I don’t remember learning this tidbit from Casey Kasem, but I can’t imagine where else I would have picked it up. Casey had the omniscience of a Trebek, with none of the smugness. And the crisp way he delivered those difficult pronunciations — <i>sukiyaki</i>, <i>neunundneunzig</i>, <i>Scylla and Charybdis —</i> showed you he cared. The dude did his homework.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-28-0-0@published data-word-count=109><strong>23. Cheap Trick, <a href=#>“The Flame”</a></strong><br>And those Long Distance Dedications! Story after story of beloved siblings in the military, long-sought birth mothers, ill-fated lovers, estranged childhood friends, and doomed pets — so many doomed pets. Aches that could only be eased by the right song. “Casey? Could you please play ‘Hard to Say I’m Sorry’ by Chicago, to let Desiree hear the words I’ve never been able to say out loud?” It was reality radio, and even if the rhythm, syntax, and vocabulary of the letters were suspiciously similar from week to week, I’ll be damned if we didn’t idle in the driveway to hear it all the way through.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-29-0-0@published data-word-count=85><strong>22. INXS, <a href=#>“New Sensation”</a></strong><br>Australia and New Zealand were having a decent week: Kylie Minogue was a bit further down the chart with “I Should Be So Lucky,” Midnight Oil debuted with “The Dead Heart,” and Crowded House’s lost classic “Better Be Home Soon” hit its peak in the low 50s. If you only know “Don’t Dream It’s Over” and “Something So Strong” from Crowded House, please go listen to “Temple of Low Men”; “When You Come” will immediately make you send a booty text, guaranteed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-30-0-0@published data-word-count=34><strong>21.

But I will say this: The guy had a point. Peppy music into pet death <i>is</i> a jarring emotional transition, and Casey cared about making our AT40 journey a smooth experience.

Whatever’s on top for the long holiday weekend is the Song of the Summer, case closed.

We’d be in transit to 11 a.m. Mass from Nos. 13-11, and while I consistently missed the Top 10, I considered it my sacrifice to God (plus, by the time a song made it that far, I’d usually have decided I was tired of hearing it).

Elton John, <a href=#>“I Don’t Wanna Go on With You Like That”</a></strong><br>In 1970, the same year Casey started American Top 40, he booked the role of Shaggy in the animated Scooby Doo series, a show I have never liked, not even as a child, and the only reason I bring it up here is to tell you that Casey Kasem was even integral to my first experience as a snob.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-47-0-0@published data-word-count=99><strong>6. Gloria Estefan & the Miami Sound Machine, <a href=#>“1-2-3”</a></strong><br>I remember pulling out of an icy church parking lot in December 1984, the week Daryl Hall & John Oates’s “Out Of Touch” ended “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go”’s three-week run at the top. “Well, I disagree with <i>this</i>,” my dad confided. “That Wham! song really <i>has</i> something, doesn’t it?” With a mixture of absolute agreement, relief that someone so close to me actually <i>got it</i>, and the deep self-loathing American culture forces a 13-year-old male Wham! fan to feel, I replied the only way I could: “I guess.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-48-0-0@published data-word-count=83><strong>5.

Eric Carmen, <a href=#>“Make Me Lose Control”</a></strong><br>The other major drawback to Dirty Dancing was the brief resurgence of Eric Carmen.

Richard Marx, <a href=#>“Hold On to the Nights”</a></strong><br>Before the 1983 debut of NBC’s Friday Night Videos, my first exposure to music videos came from <i>America’s Top 10</i>, Casey’s weekly syndicated countdown show. Tantalizing glimpses of Rick Springfield, Kim Carnes, and Blondie, and at the center of it all, Casey Kasem, exuberant and ageless in early Cosby sweaters, showing that his enthusiasm wasn’t just some kind of vocal trick.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-52-0-0@published data-word-count=19><strong>2.

Steve Winwood, <a href=#>“Roll With It”</a></strong><br>Listen: Pre-internet America could be a lonely place for us kids who took pop music seriously. Our parents, our teachers, our peers lined up to tell us our interests were frivolous, foolish, minor. But for four hours a week, Casey Kasem showed us a place on the map where grown-ups believed the Top 40 was worthy of interest and analysis. He made us believe there was room for us. He showed us that reaching for the stars while keeping our feet on the ground was absolutely possible. He made us feel less alone in the world, long before we were able to find each other here.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fcc8f23a2008551f9cb172366cf9c7e5-54-0-0@published data-word-count=12>His was a life well lived.
