However, Katina would soon learn her new husband’s unrealistic expectations for a “traditional wife.”&nbsp;</p><p>“As much as I’m loving you, I got to be real with you. I have to keep you grounded because I have to know when I say ‘Yes’ on Decision Day, I know you can hold this s—t down,” he told her during a March 2022 episode. “But when it comes to a marriage, there are some of these things that I expect to be already there. That’s what I’m trying to figure out, if you have that base.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While Katina and Olajuwon said ‘Yes’ on Decision Day, the pair sadly announced their split in November 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>“After one year of marriage and careful thought and consideration, we have decided to part ways,” the couple’s joint statement read on Instagram. “However, this was not an easy decision to make. We leave our marriage with enormous love and respect for each other. We only ask that, at this time, our privacy is respected.”</p><p>However, only a month later, the pair sparked reconciliation rumors after reuniting for a tropical vacation in December 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>“Never forget you’re a fearless woman! You fight every fear from animals ‘Alpacas’ to deep ocean swimming ‘snorkeling’ and more!” the season 14 alum wrote via Instagram, in a post dedicated to his <i>MAFS </i>bride. “Thank you for always having faith in whatever my heart and mind desires in life. Thank you for making sure I have a strong relationship with God. I appreciate everything you have taught me about myself without you even knowing it.”</p><p>He went on to thank the <i>MAFS</i> franchise for introducing him to Katina and added, “God is good in so many ways I get emotional just thinking of my life and how much I have matured as a man. I am truly thankful words can’t express it.”</p><p>Their reunion didn’t last long as the couple seemingly split again by February 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>“We both have made the decision to walk away from our marriage. We are officially legally separated,” Olajuwon wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post on February 9, 2023. “We leave with the utmost respect for each other. At this moment, we ask for space. Thank you to everyone who supported us.”</p><p>In March 2023, it was announced that Olajuwon and Katina were set to appear on <i>Married at First Sight: Couples Couch</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While the couple is seemingly not together, that same month, Olajuwon took to Instagram to share a few throwback photos with Katina. In one snap, he nuzzled close to his rumored ex as he tagged her Instagram handle in the post.</p><p>The off-again, on-again couple continued to confuse fans in June 2023, when Olajuwon and Katina shared that they were on a vacation in the Bahamas together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJopJqqop6ypXnArWSfoaKowW6%2FyKCfrWWjqbatuIymmKuqmZqxbn2RcG9sbl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-is-blinds-izzy-introduces-new-girlfriend-after-stacy-split.html><span>←</span><span>Love Is Blinds Izzy Introduces New Girlfriend After Stacy Split</span></a>
