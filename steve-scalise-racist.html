White Supremacist Controversy</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>The previous presumed racist controversy of Steve Scalise has come up in the spotlight as his opposition looks at the replacement candidate for Kevin McCarthy.</strong></p><p>Stephen Scalise, born on October 6, 1965, is an American politician who is currently the House Majority Leader.</p><p>He has also been the U.S. Representative for Louisiana’s 1st congressional district since 2008.</p><p>He is a member of the Republican Party, previously serving as the House Majority Whip from 2014 to 2019. Additionally, he also served as the House Minority Whip from 2019 to 2023.</p><p>Interestingly, he’s the first person from Louisiana to serve as Majority Whip since Hale Boggs from Louisiana’s 2nd congressional district held that position from 1962 to 1971.</p><p>Furthermore, in 2017, Scalise became the dean of the Louisiana congressional delegation after Senator David Vitter retired.</p><p>Now, the previous controversy, which is related to Steve Scalise presumably giving a racist speech, has resurfaced.</p><h2>Did Steve Scalise Make Racist Speech? White Supremacist Controversy</h2><p>In 2002, Steve Scalise spoke at a gathering organized by the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), a group associated with David Duke.</p><p>This information came to light in 2014 when political blogger Lamar White, Jr. uncovered comments from 2002 on Stormfront, a white supremacist website, that mentioned Scalise as a speaker at the 2002 convention.</p><p>He also acknowledged that he had spoken at the conference. He had said,</p><p>I didn’t know who all of these groups were and I detest any kind of hate group. For anyone to suggest that I was involved with a group like that is insulting and ludicrous.</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors extremist groups, categorizes EURO as a “white nationalist” hate group.</p><p>The founder of the EURO group, David Duke, has become notorious as the former Ku Klux Klan leader.</p><p>David Duke has a history of promoting white supremacy and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. He was previously a grand wizard or the national leader of the Ku Klux Klan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thiswastv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steve-Scalise-hand-shake.jpg><p>Much of his political and written work revolves around spreading unfounded conspiracy theories about Jews.</p><p>It includes denying the Holocaust and suggesting Jewish influence over education, the media, and the financial system.</p><p>In 2013, the Anti-Defamation League referred to Duke as “perhaps America’s most well-known racist and anti-Semite”.</p><p>As such, Steve Scalise found himself in a racist controversy from the information that came out saying he spoke at one of David’s conferences.</p><p>Though he has said that he regrets this action.</p><p><strong>Also See:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Bernie Moreno Wikipedia: The US Senate Candidate Twitter Controversy.</a></p><h2>Steve Scalise Said ‘I Regret’ Doing Speech</h2><p>Steve Scalise had previously apologized publicly for making the speech at EURO in 2002.</p><p>In 2014, when the controversy first happened, he explained that he delivered the EURO speech to <a href=# rel=noopener>gather support</a> for a tax plan he was advocating for in the state legislature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thiswastv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steve-Scalise-nasa.jpg><p>As per Politico, Steve said in his statement that he spoke to many different Louisiana groups as a state representative.</p><p>He just wanted to build support for legislation that focused on cutting wasteful state spending, eliminating government corruption, and stopping tax hikes.</p><p>He added,</p><p>One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn. It was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold……</p><p>Recently, the controversy resurfaced as his opposition looked to bring up his past since he is one of the candidates for replacing the Speaker, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kevin McCarthy</a>.</p><p><strong>More From Us:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Lunden And Olivia Racist Tweets: What Were They?
