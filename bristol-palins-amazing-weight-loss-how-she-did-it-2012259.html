He thinks he's a teenager already."</p><p>Palin's mom, former Alaska governor <strong>Sarah Palin</strong> and father, <strong>Todd</strong>, joined her son Tripp, 3, in the audience to watch the DWTS premiere, and the returning celeb dancer told <strong>Us</strong> her family remains a huge motivating factor in her ballroom success. "If I ever hear anything bad that's being said about me or my family, it just gives me motivation to do better, and that's what I do!" reasoned the reality TV veteran, who starred in Lifetime's Life's a Tripp after her first DWTS stint in 2010.</p><p>As they face off against DWTS: All-Stars competition <strong>Kirstie Alley, Pamela Anderson </strong>and others this season, Palin and Ballas look forward to using her newfound confidence to their advantage in the rehearsal studio.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>VIDEO: Kirstie Alley wants to become a "size zero" during DWTS: All-Stars<br></p><p>"We picked up where we left off.
