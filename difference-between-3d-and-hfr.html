So why are people mentioning an HFR format? What's the difference between HFR and 3D? Here's what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's the difference between 3D and HFR? Or, rather: What is 3D with HFR?</h2><p>HFR stands for high frame rates. Typically a film will run at 24 frames per second — so viewing something in an HFR format means you're watching it at a higher frame rate than the industry standard.</p><p>So why would you want to do that? Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mashable</a>, HFR has actually caused some moviegoers to feel nauseated (probably because our brains are so used to 24 FPS?).</p><p>With this format, a film can take on "a more 'realistic' visual texture. Everything is so smooth, it’s as if the actors are in the room with you," the outlet notes.</p><p>It appears that Avatar: The Way of Water is utilizing the HFR for certain 3D versions of the film, and only for certain scenes (mainly underwater ones).</p><p>And apparently not all theater chains are advertising whether their 3D versions feature the HFR experience, so may have to ask.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>It seems that if you're seeing the regular 2D version, none of this will apply. As James Cameron himself explained to Yahoo: "The one thing I will say pretty definitively is that 48 frames doesn't benefit a 2D movie very much, if at all. It's really about making a better experience in 3D."</p><p>And apparently not everyone loves the HFR experience, so it's up to you which version suits you best.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Sam Adams of Slate experienced the HFR in Avatar: The Way of Water, and wrote this about his experience: "For me, high frame rates make it feel less like you’re watching a movie and more like you’re on the set watching it get made. When I watched The Hobbit in 3D HFR, I didn’t see Bilbo Baggins—I saw the actor playing him."</p><p>He added, "My reaction to watching Avatar: The Way of Water in HFR started off the same way, even though Cameron applies the HFR more selectively than [Peter Jackson, the director of The Hobbit] did." According to Sam's report, HFR is utilized more in action/setting scenes, as opposed to character driven moments in Avatar: The Way of the Water. He mentioned that eventually he got used to the HFR.</p><p>Do you have plans to see the three-hour, 12-minute long film? Avatar: The Way of Water is in theaters now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbanssSrnKeblWKvpsDWnpynZWOZeqK6w2afn6o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-brandis-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Brandis Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
