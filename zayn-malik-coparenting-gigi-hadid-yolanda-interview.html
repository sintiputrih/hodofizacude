In terms of, I can do things and I can achieve things and I can overcome things—and you can do this, too,” he told Cooper. “To let things like a feeling stop you from doing that after having a child feels like a really small thing. I feel like I’ve had to step up as a man or just as a person. And be this example to her the doesn’t succumb to these feelings. That’s why I’m even doing this interview. I used to get a lot of anxiety around having a conversation like this, just in this kind of environment. And I want her to able to look at me and be like, ‘My dad’s doing this, he’s the man.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He added that dealing with fame has made him ultra protective of his daughter’s right to privacy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There’s just people always there waiting to take a photo,” Malik explained. “Obviously, thinking about having a child and raising her in that environment, it was just very claustrophobic for me. I didn’t want her to have to be exposed to that because she didn’t choose it. It was a choice that I made. So I was like, ‘We need to get out of here so that she can have some chance of a normal childhood.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The former couple are known to often <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a37024549/gigi-hadid-motherhood-pressures-daughter-khai/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="spend time with Khai" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">spend time with Khai</a> at Hadid’s family farm in Pennsylvania.</p><img alt="celebrity sightings in new york city march 25, 2021" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - March 25, 2021" width=2835 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gigi-hadid-and-zayn-malik-are-seen-walking-in-soho-on-march-news-photo-1689170193.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Raymond Hall</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik push Khai in a stroller.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He also touched on his and Hadid’s 50-50 custody arrangement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I have her 50 percent of the time, so that time I have with her is so important because I feel like she’s growing up so fast. So, when I’m with her I don’t work at all,” he said, adding that he spends a “full day with [Khai]” doing any activity she wants to do, like painting, playing with Play-Doh, or heading out to a theme park or zoo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We just have fun. I feel like I’ve rekindled my own childhood through her,” the singer continued. “I feel like we get to a certain point in adult life where everything’s kind of vague and gray and boring, and she’s brought that color back for me for sure.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Malik revealed that Khai has already shown a predisposition for music.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She shows a lot of signs of musical intelligence already, so I just love playing instruments with her and singing with her. I’ll sing and she sings along and she can do good harmonies and stuff already—and she’s only two and a half,” he said. “She harmonizes with me well and finishes notes, can hold them for a long time. … She remembers full lyrics to songs as well, like every word. Smart.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for his co-parenting relationship with Hadid, Malik said, “Co-parenting is good.

Around the time of their breakup, the model’s mother, Yolanda Hadid, alleged that Malik had struck her during a verbal altercation. He <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/zaynmalik/status/1453794713224482826 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="denied the allegation" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">denied the allegation</a> in a statement posted to his social media.

He was also mandated to complete an anger management class and a domestic violence program.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In this latest interview, Malik spoke publicly about the incident with Yolanda for the first time. “I don’t tend to get involved when people say things online, whether it’s got something to do with me or whether it doesn’t. Because, for me, my most valuable thing that I have in life is time, and that takes so much time in a toxic environment to explain yourself to people and justify this, so I just kind of keep to myself,” he said. “I knew what the situation was, I knew what happened and the people involved knew what happened, too. And that’s all I really cared about.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Malik added that he didn’t want to draw more attention to the situation. “I just wasn’t trying to get into a negative back-and-forth with her,” he explained. “Any sort of narrative online where my daughter was going to look back and read that and be able to read into it, and it would just be something that—there was no point. I believe I dealt with it in the best way. In an amicable, respectful way. And that’s all that needs to be sad. … If something happens in the family, I’d rather keep that between the family. You don’t need a whole audience of people and opinions, because it’s hard enough to manage between two.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
