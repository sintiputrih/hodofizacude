Roppo dreamed about becoming a basketballer during childhood, and his father spent every weekend playing with him. When Joey turned 16, he started playing for his school team. He kept representing his school even during high school.</p><p>In 2011, Roppo joined the University of Central Washington to study for a bachelor’s degree in IT and administrative management, and with studies, he also played college football.

Currently, he is employed at an entity named Expeditors as a Customs Brokerage.</p><p>After working in the corporate sector for more than four years in 2022, Roppo started a new journey when he starred with his younger sister <a href=# rel=noopener>Corrina Roppo</a> in “Dated & Related,” a Netflix show. “D & R” was a huge success, and Joey’s appearance in the show helped him earn thousands of fans.</p><p>According to sources, he is getting offers from modeling agencies, and even an acting job got offered to him.
