<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>What does Survivor need to bring back to make loyal fans engage more?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>When a Survivor player gets eliminated, they are taken to Ponderosa which is essentially a hotel. The players who make it to the jury stay at Ponderosa until after they fly home following the final tribal council. For many years, videos were produced and released showing the highlights of the jury member’s experiences at Ponderosa. That allowed loyal fans to see those players see things like the jury members’ first meals, their reactions to their weight loss, and any arguments that may take place. Ever since Survivor 42, the show has stopped releasing those Ponderosa videos. That is a crying shame since the Ponderosa videos allowed fans to care more about the show, about the jury members, and about who would win.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-17t095344-295.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaqVlrFww8eaq2acn5rAbr%2FUq62irp%2Bneq%2BxxJ1kraddl7%2BqusZmmZqbm2LBsHnMmqKeZZykxqK4jJ%2BYp6tdmruorcaeZKanopp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./take-vultures-saved-by-the-bell-superfan-quiz-html.html><span>←</span><span>Take Vultures Saved by the Bell Superfan Quiz</span></a>
