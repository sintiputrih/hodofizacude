Ray Pillar of Character Award. He said: "My brother was born with cerebral palsy and it taught me that loving people isn't a choice and that people aren't actually all created equal. The Constitution lies to us. We're not all created equal. We're all created incredibly inequal to one another, in our capabilities and what we can do and how we think and what we see. But we all have the equal capacity to love one another, and my brother taught me that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQcmduamJsgHSCkWianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmam1bsDWoqWsZZOdtq2w0Z6lZquZl7mqusZmrKmckamycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bravotv-com-link.html><span>←</span><span>Bravotv.com Link How to Enter Bravo TV Activation Code on Smart Devices</span></a>
